UN court to hear South Africa genocide case against Israel|"The UN's International Court of Justice is to hear a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The submission also calls on the court to order Israel to stop military operations there.The ICJ will deliver only an opinion on the genocide allegation as the case is not a criminal trial, although it is being keenly watched. Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as baseless.In its submission, South Africa says Israel's actions ""are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".It says Israel's actions include ""killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction"". It calls for ""provisional measures"" to be implemented by the court, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations ""atrocious and preposterous"". ""We will be in the International Court of Justice and we will present proudly our case of using self-defence… under humanitarian law,"" he said. He added that the Israeli army was ""doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties"". What is the genocide case against Israel?South Africa files ICJ case accusing Israel of 'genocidal acts'The ICJ - the UN court based in the Hague in the Netherlands - could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign - but a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take years. ICJ rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. In 2022, the court ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine, an order that was ignored. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza, and its governing African National Congress has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.In Gaza, more than 23,350 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas's 7 October attacks on southern Israel. In those attacks some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?|"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"".The ICJ is the United Nations's top court.Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions.South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza.Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the groupdeliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in partimposing measures intended to prevent births within the groupforcibly transferring children of the group to another groupWhy are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible.""Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included:airdropping flyers warning of imminent attackscalling civilians' phones to urge them to leave targeted buildingsaborting some strikes when civilians are in the wayAnd the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people.UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza.But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful.""I don't agree with it.""I don't think it's right.""South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored.Israel says war expected to continue throughout 2024The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years.South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says.The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages.But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".Israel-Hamas conflict exposes South Africa's divisionsAdditional reporting by Damian Zane."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B86/production/_132262572_gettyimages-1858703425.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Raffi Berg|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67922346?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Republican debate: Five takeaways as Haley and DeSantis face off|"Republican presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley squared off in a tense debate on Wednesday, trading barbs just days before the Iowa caucuses.Donald Trump, the consistent frontrunner in the race for the party's 2024 nomination, once again chose not to attend and held a Fox News town hall event at the same time.  But despite the former president's commanding lead in the polls and absence from the stage, the stakes were still high at the debate in a snowy Des Moines. Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley are battling to position themselves as the main alternative to Mr Trump in the race, and both will be hoping a strong second place finish in Iowa on Monday could breathe new life into their campaigns. Here's what we learned when they went head to head.Things got off to a heated start when the pair traded insults in their very first answers.Mr DeSantis, 45, began proceedings by calling his opponent ""another mealy-mouthed politician that tells you what she thinks you want to hear"".Ms Haley then shot back and took aim at what she called Mr DeSantis's repeated ""lies"".""You're going to find out about a lot of Ron's lies,"" she said.There have been four Republican debates before this, but the one-on-one nature of this one, which was hosted by CNN at Drake University, resulted in far more direct attacks and testy exchanges.It seemed as though both were hoping to land a knockout blow before Republicans in Iowa kickstart the next phase of this race and pick their preferred presidential candidate on Monday. The theme of the night? Attack, attack attack.As the two candidates battled on stage, the former president was three miles (5km) away holding an event with his supporters. The question of his absence, and his lead in the polls, unsurprisingly came soon in the debate. Mr DeSantis accused the former president of ""running to pursue his issues"" and ignoring the needs of American families. He said Mr Trump spewed ""word vomit"" on social media and cast doubt on his ability to get through the legal battles he is facing. Why Trump’s rivals in Iowa still think they can win Christie exits 2024 race with parting shot at TrumpMs Haley, for her part, once again said that she did not believe Mr Trump was ""the right president to go forward"".Both were more vocal in their criticism of him than in previous debates, taking aim at his handling of issues ranging from the pandemic to border security and relations with China. At his own event in Des Moines, Mr Trump also took aim at both candidates and touted the ""tremendous"" levels of support he has in Iowa. Additionally, his campaign sent out several emails during the rival debate, criticising Ms Haley and Mr DeSantis on a range of issues including Ms Haley's ""childish"" foreign policy positions and China and Mr DeSantis' ""lying record on Covid."" Border security and immigration came up repeatedly, a reflection of the polls that show it is a primary concern for Republican voters in Iowa and around the US.Mr DeSantis urged the crowd to ""not trust"" Ms Haley with immigration. ""That's like having the fox guard the henhouse,"" he said, pointing to earlier comments in which she referred to the term ""illegal aliens"" as ""disrespectful"". Ms Haley mostly struck a more nuanced tone on the subject, referring to the root causes of migration in Central and South America and touting her credentials as a former ambassador to the United Nations. She did, however, say undocumented migrants should be deported for ""cutting the line"".The war in Ukraine proved to be one of the most contentious issues of the night, and both candidates sparred with one another over their positions on the conflict.Ms Haley hit out at Mr DeSantis for initially backing US funds for Ukraine, and then later changing his position.""Nobody knows what he believes,"" she said. ""Let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. This is a freedom loving country,"" she said, adding that it was a ""friend"" of America and that US support was about ""preventing war"". Mr DeSantis responded by saying the war needed to end, and ""people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine's border than our southern border"".The clashes over Ukraine mirror a wider rift in the Republican Party, which has been split over US foreign policy and continued assistance to Ukraine. The audience of 200 or so at the venue in Des Moines was also far from raucous, but Mr DeSantis seemed to get the larger share of the applause.Some of his comments, including one moment where he described Ms Haley as having a problem with ""ballistic podiatry"" (in other words, shooting herself in the foot) prompted a good response in the room.That is perhaps unsurprising, as Iowa is widely seen as more favourable to him than other states such as New Hampshire, where the second Republican contest will take place and Nikki Haley is expected to perform better.Ms Haley did have some memorable moments herself, and received a loud cheer when she described the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 as a ""terrible day"".Afterwards her campaign staff and supporters said they saw the event as a victory that will propel her going into the New Hampshire primary. ""Tonight was a success,"" Texas congressman Will Hurd told the BBC. ""More people were Googling Nikki Haley than Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump combined. Her momentum is continuing."" But in a room not far from the venue, at his separate town hall in front of a favourable crowd, Mr Trump experienced a stronger reaction. His supporters shouted ""we love you"" throughout the event and he shook hands for more than 10 minutes after it finished.If Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley are to seriously challenge the former president, they will need to tempt some of these Iowan voters away from him before Monday's critical caucuses."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14395/production/_132273828_gettyimages-1915747874.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Bernd Debusmann Jr|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67942133?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Chris Christie exits 2024 White House race with parting shot at Trump|"Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has dropped out of the presidential race with a parting shot at frontrunner Donald Trump.""I am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again,"" the Trump ally-turned-critic said.The Republican had faced pressure to step aside and allow the party to unify around a viable challenger to Mr Trump.He did not endorse anyone as he bowed out of the race.But on a hot mic moments before he announced he was ending his bid, Mr Christie predicted that Nikki Haley, who has been gaining on Mr Trump in some polls, was ""going to get smoked, and you and I both know it"".""She's not up to this,"" he added. He also said another rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, was ""petrified"".Mr Christie, 61, who nationally has been polling in the low single figures, said he was suspending his campaign at a town hall event in the US state of New Hampshire on Wednesday afternoon.He devoted much of his remarks to a plea to Republican voters to reject the former president, who he accused of ""putting himself before the people of this country"".""Donald Trump wants you to be angry every day because he is angry,"" he added.His departure comes five days before the Iowa caucuses, the first of the state-by-state contests in which Republican voters will pick their preferred candidate for president.The eventual winner will be anointed the Republican nominee in July, before going on to challenge the Democratic nominee - likely Joe Biden - in the November general election.Mr Christie had been urged to drop out ahead of the second contest this month in New Hampshire, where some surveys indicate Ms Haley could be catching up with Mr Trump. The north-eastern state has a large faction of unaffiliated voters and has been known to deliver unpredictable results. Mr Christie has been polling at 12% there and many of his supporters may now back Ms Haley.In a statement, Ms Haley called Mr Christie ""a friend for many years"" and commended him ""on a hard-fought campaign"".Haley and DeSantis to face off in Iowa debateHow important are the Iowa caucuses this election?But her opponents were quick to chime in on social media.Mr DeSantis said he agreed Ms Haley is ""going to get smoked"". Mr Trump said he ""might even get to like [Mr Christie] again"" following his ""very truthful statement"" about Ms Haley.The former president's political action committee said in a statement that he had ""already vanquished eight challengers before a single vote has been cast because Republican voters want a strong leader who will reboot our economy, secure our border, make America energy independent again, and keep our families safe"".This was Mr Christie's second unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination - he lost to Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Christie had hoped to act as an attack dog for a field of Trump rivals who dared not cross the Republican base, which remains deeply loyal to the former president.The strategy resulted in some zingers during the primary debates, but without Mr Trump on stage, Mr Christie failed to land any direct blows.Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist based in New Hampshire, said Mr Christie had faced up to political reality.""Republican voters do not want to hear the same attacks that they've heard from Democrats or even the media for the better part of eight years,"" Mr Bartlett said.

Streets empty as Ecuador reels from violence|"Soldiers are on the streets in several cities in Ecuador as the country reels from an unprecedented day of violence.Masked gunmen stormed a public TV studio during a live broadcast in the city of Guayaquil and bombs were detonated across Ecuador on Tuesday. More than 130 prison staff are being held hostage by inmates in five jails.A 60-day state of emergency began on Monday after a notorious gangster vanished from his prison cell.It is unclear whether the attack on the TV studio in Ecuador's largest city was related to the disappearance of the boss of the Choneros gang, Adolfo Macías Villamar, or Fito, as he is better known. President Daniel Noboa declared the state of emergency in response to a wave of recent jail riots and escapes from prisons and other acts of violence blamed by authorities on criminal gangs.He ordered that criminal gangs be ""neutralised"" and said that an ""internal armed conflict"" existed within the country.The government says the violence is a reaction to President Noboa's plan to build a new high security prison for gang leaders. The president said on Wednesday that Ecuador would begin to deport foreign prisoners, especially Colombians, to reduce the number of inmates.Esteban Torres Cobo, a vice minister in President Noboa's government, said the war on armed gangs could result in many deaths and casualties. ""It's going to be bloody but this is the change we need in order to have a better future, we cannot be postponing this decision throughout the years, we have to take decision now,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. He said gang leaders were asking for mediation but that the ""government is not going to negotiate with no-one.""A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very much alarmed by the deteriorating situation"" and the ""disruptive impact on the lives of Ecuadorans"".Meanwhile, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the US ""strongly condemned"" the recent attacks, while National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Washington was committed to ""helping support security and prosperity for the people of Ecuador"". Ecuador inmates seize guards after drug lord's escapeEcuador declares war on gangs after TV attackHours after the most brazen of the attacks, Guayaquil was like a city waking up from a strange nightmare. Despite the deteriorating security situation over recent years, few could have expected to see the anchor of state television channel TC with a gun pointed at his head, live on air.Police have made 70 arrests since Monday, including in response to the storming of the TV station. The ripple effect of that brazen attack has been to send people for cover, even a day later. The streets are largely empty for a weekday. Many say the situation reminds them of life during the Covid pandemic.Hundreds of soldiers, including in tanks, are patrolling the streets of Guayaquil and the capital, Quito.Across the country, schools have remained closed, with lessons taking place online. China, a major investor in Ecuador, also announced it was temporarily shutting its embassy and consulates.Inside the businesses which remain open in Guayaquil, jumpy private security guards are keeping the doors closed, only allowing people in with caution. Eduardo, who works for an international clothing firm, said he was in the street buying coffee at the moment the chaos started to unfold and by the time he returned to the office, his colleagues had already started to pack up and leave.""Today, everyone is working from home,"" he said. Some 125 prison guards and 14 administrative staff are being held hostage across Ecuador, the SNAI prisons agency says. Four police officers, who authorities say were kidnapped by criminals between Monday and Tuesday, are also being held. Three other officers were freed late on Tuesday.Police say violence is ongoing in Guayaquil. Eight people were killed and three injured in attacks linked to criminal gangs in the city on Tuesday while two police officers were killed by ""armed criminals"" in the nearby town of Nobol, police said. Police say they are in the process of identifying three bodies which were found in a burned-out car in the south of the city overnight. This is an unprecedented situation for the people of Guayaquil - they have seen political protests and other violent incidents over the years but nothing on the scale of the sheer panic which gripped the city on Tuesday. Students ran in fear as gunmen entered their university corridors and bombs were detonated around the country, raising fears that the attacks were co-ordinated. Those who must venture out, for work or to visit family, are doing so with great trepidation. It has been an exhausting, upsetting 24 hours in Ecuador's main port. In recent years, Ecuador's prisons have been plagued by violent feuds between jailed members of rival gangs, often resulting in multiple massacres of inmates. President Noboa's emergency declaration listed the Choneros (named after the town of Chone in Manabi Province) as well as 21 other gangs as behind the recent spate of violence.The order built on the state of emergency declared on Monday, which ordains a nightly curfew in an attempt to curb violence following Fito's escape. Security forces have been trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday.The escape of Fito represents a huge blow to Mr Noboa's presidency, barely seven weeks old.President Noboa, at the age of 36, became Ecuador's youngest leader to be democratically elected, winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate and journalist Fernando Villavicencio.Villavicencio had reported receiving death threats from Fito just days before he was shot dead while leaving a campaign rally in Quito."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B79/production/_132271432_guayaquil.png|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By James Gregory & Will Grant|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-67938285?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Swedish alarm after defence chiefs' war warning|"A warning to Swedes from two top defence officials to prepare for war has prompted concern and accusations of alarmism.Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told a defence conference ""there could be war in Sweden"".His message was then backed up by military commander-in-chief Gen Micael Byden, who said all Swedes should prepare mentally for the possibility.However, opposition politicians have objected to the tone of the warnings.Ex-prime minister Magdalena Andersson told Swedish TV that while the security situation was serious, ""it is not as if war is just outside the door.""Children's rights organisation Bris said that its national helpline did not usually receive calls about the possibility of war. But this week, it had seen an increase in worried calls from youngsters who had seen news reports or posts on TikTok talking about it.""This was well prepared, it wasn't something blurted out,"" Bris spokeswoman Maja Dahl told the BBC. ""They should have provided information meant for kids when they come out with this kind of information for grown-ups.""Despite the starkness of the messaging, the remarks from the civil defence minister and military chief are being seen as a wake-up call.After more than two centuries of peace, Sweden is a few steps from joining the Nato defensive alliance, waiting for a green light from Turkey's parliament and then from Hungary. The commander-in-chief said his remarks were nothing new. He visited Ukraine's eastern front a month ago and Sweden is one of a group of countries training Ukrainian pilots. Stockholm is also said to be considering sending advanced Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine.""My ambition with this is not to worry people; my ambition is to get more people to think about their own situation and their own responsibilities,"" Gen Byden later told Aftonbladet newspaper.Finland has already joined Nato, and Russian officials have suggested it will be ""the first to suffer"" if tensions with Nato escalate.How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to NatoSweden's civil defence minister said his aim was not for people to lose sleep, but to gain awareness of what was really going on. He appealed to local authorities, emergency planners and individuals to respond.""If there is one thing that keeps me awake at night, it is the feeling that things are moving too slowly,"" Mr Bohlin told the Society and Defence conference on Sunday.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Sweden during the conference to work with his country and others to manufacture weapons and ""get stronger together"".Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson added that in 2024, Sweden would meet Nato's target of spending 2% of economic output (GDP) on military defence, doubling its spending since 2020. Defence specialist Oscar Jonsson said the tone of the warnings from defence chiefs was something of a storm in a teacup and that 90% of what had been said arose from frustration that too little was being done to build civil and military defence.""Time is limited and it was aimed at being a wake-up call for agencies, individuals and departments,"" he told the BBC.""The Swedish armed forces are incredibly competent, but the scale is nowhere near. The latest defence bill says we should set up 3.5 brigades, whereas Ukraine had 28 when the war started.""Gen Byden's warning to prepare mentally for war comes hard on the heels of a warning a month ago from the head of Poland's National Security Bureau (BBN), Jacek Siewiera, who said that ""to avoid war with Russia, countries on Nato's eastern flank should adopt a three-year time horizon to prepare for confrontation"".He said a German Council on Foreign Relations report suggesting Germany and Nato should prepare their armed forces to be able to fend off a Russian attack in six years was ""too optimistic"".Oscar Jonsson, a specialist from the Swedish Defence University, said that while war was a possibility, it would require several factors to fall into place: Russia's war in Ukraine coming to an end, its military having the time to rebuild and rearm its fighting force and for Europe to lose US military support. All of which were within the realms of possibility, he added."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17E5/production/_132271160_gettyimages-1662883735.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Paul Kirby|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67935464?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea|"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night.The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks.The text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. The Houthis reacted scornfully to it.Their spokesman Mohammed Ali al-Houthi called the resolution a ""political game"".  They claim to be targeting Israeli-linked vessels, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.The UN resolution demanded ""that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks, which impede global commerce and undermine navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace and security"". Eleven nations voted for it, but Russia, China, Mozambique and Algeria abstained.Earlier, the US and several allies warned of ""consequences"" for the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space.""The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.The Houthis said they targeted a US ship on Tuesday providing support to Israel. It was the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.Hard choices for the West in Red Sea stand-offWhat do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?Listen: Who are the Houthi rebels - BBC SoundsThe US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT).Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond.HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said.No injuries or damage were reported.Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"".Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"".A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"".Mr Shapps warned on Wednesday that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"".""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added.Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop.Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'.""He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping.They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"".It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident.Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression.They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships.Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia.The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October.Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority.In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance.Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo.

Ukraine war: Russian missiles wreck Kharkiv hotel - governor|"Two Russian missiles have struck a hotel in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, injuring 11 people, the Kharkiv governor says.Photos from Ukraine's State Emergency Service showed the hotel heavily damaged and firefighters at the scene.Governor Oleh Synehubov said the injured included Turkish journalists. Two S-300 missiles struck at about 22:30 (20:30 GMT), he said.Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukrainian cities in the past two weeks.Ukrainian officials say dozens of civilians have died in those attacks from drones and missiles.Kharkiv, just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border, has suffered extensive damage from Russian air strikes since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In the latest strike, nine injured were taken to hospital, including a 35-year-old man in a serious condition, the governor said on the Telegram messaging service.The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, quoted by Ukraine's Unian news agency, said ""there were no military at all"" in the hotel at the time, but 30 civilians were there. It is in the city's central Kyiv district. He said several homes and cars nearby were also damaged.The Russian city of Belgorod, 74km north of Kharkiv, was hit by Ukrainian missiles and drones on 30 December which Russian officials say killed 25 civilians. Russia has started moving hundreds of Belgorod children to holiday camps further away from Ukraine for three-week stays. A camp in Voronezh region received 93 on Wednesday and later 280 arrived in Kaluga region, state TV reported, adding that teachers would join them there. What lies behind Russia's mounting air strikes on UkraineRussians move people from city hit by UkrainePresident Volodymyr Zelensky, on a visit to Lithuania on Wednesday, urged Western allies to provide more air defence weapons. The Baltic nation is among the staunchest allies of Ukraine in bolstering Kyiv's resistance to the Russian forces.""Air defence systems are what we lack the most. The fight against drones. I am happy that we have agreements with Lithuania and many other partners,"" he said in Vilnius. Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Estonia, are ex-Soviet states now in the Nato alliance.In terms of GDP, Lithuania is the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy reports. The US contribution to Ukraine's defence is, however, by far the largest.Mr Zelensky, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine, said Vladimir Putin ""will not calm down until he destroys Ukraine"". ""He wants to fully occupy us. And sometimes our partners' doubts over financial and military assistance to Ukraine, quick reaction, gives courage and strength to the Russian Federation.""He said the Russian leader ""won't finish this [war], until we all finish him together"" and warned that the Baltic states and Moldova ""may be next"". In recent days, the Ukrainian leader has held intensive talks with Western allies aimed at maintaining vital arms deliveries. Kyiv's counter-offensive late last year made little progress, and some in the West have questioned Kyiv's strategy, fuelling concern about the cost of the war.With Russia now committed to much higher military expenditure, Nato countries are struggling to boost production of artillery shells and other heavy weapons.An EU aid package worth €50bn (£43bn; $55bn) for Ukraine is stuck because of a Hungarian veto, while the divided US Congress has stalled over a new tranche of military aid.After a video conference with the Ukrainian government on Wednesday, Nato said it had plans to provide ""billions of euros of further capabilities"" to Ukraine this year.""Nato strongly condemns Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including with weapons from North Korea and Iran,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10C81/production/_132273786_mediaitem132273785.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Laurence Peter|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67942020?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Austrian heiress Marlene Engelhorn announces plan for €25m giveaway|"An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother.  Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how €25m (£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed.  ""I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,"" she said.""And the state doesn't even want taxes on it.""Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, one of a handful of European countries that do not impose inheritance tax - or death duties.Ms Engelhorn believes that is unfair.She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, the founder of German chemical and pharmaceutical company, BASF, and inherited millions when her grandmother died in September 2022.Traudl Engelhorn-Vechiatto's wealth was estimated by US magazine Forbes at $4.2bn (£3.3bn; €3.8bn), and even before she died her grand-daughter had declared that she wanted to hand out about 90% of her inheritance. On Wednesday, 10,000 invitations targeting randomly selected Austrian citizens began arriving in letterboxes in Austria.Those who wish to take part in Ms Engelhorn's initiative, known as the Good Council for Redistribution, can register online or by phone. From that initial sample of 10,000 Austrians who are all aged over 16, 50 people will be chosen, with 15 substitute members also selected in case of dropouts.""If politicians don't do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself,"" she explained in her statement.""Many people struggle to make ends meet with a full-time job, and pay taxes on every euro they earn from work. I see this as a failure of politics, and if politics fails, then the citizens have to deal with it themselves.""Christoph Hofinger, Managing Director of the Foresight Institute which is supporting the initiative, said the council to redistribute the heiress's money would be made up of 50 people ""from all age groups, federal states, social classes and backgrounds"". The group will be asked to ""contribute their ideas in order to jointly develop solutions in the interests of society as a whole"", he said. They will take part in a series of meetings to be held in Salzburg with academics and civil society organisations from March to June this year.Organisers say the meetings will be barrier-free, with childcare and interpreters available if required. Travel costs will be covered and participants will receive €1,200 for every weekend they attend.  Marlene Engelhorn believes their discussions will be a ""service to democracy"" and so they should be properly compensated for it. ""I have no veto rights,"" she said: ""I am putting my assets at the disposal of these 50 people and placing my trust in them."" If they cannot come up with a ""widely supported"" decision on what to do with the money, then the money goes back to Ms Engelhorn.It is not clear exactly what proportion of her inheritance is being given away, although back in 2021 she said she wanted to hand out at least 90% of it because she had done nothing to earn it and had merely struck lucky in a ""birth lottery"".Her team has not confirmed how much she is holding back although it said she was retaining some kind of financial buffer. Sixteen years after Austria abolished inheritance tax, it remains contentious, and one major political party, the opposition Social Democrats, wants it reinstated.Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler told public broadcaster ORF that he wanted it to be a central condition for potential coalition negotiations, after Austria's next general election which is due later this year.  The conservative People's Party, which is currently the senior partner in Austria's coalition government with the Greens, has rejected his proposal.Its general secretary, Christian Stocker, said that while Mr Babler wanted to ""to further burden people in our country with his call for a wealth and inheritance tax, the People's Party is providing relief. We reject new taxes; people must be left with more net income."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5CCC/production/_132265732_obs_20240109_obs0032.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Bethany Bell|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67935463?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Papua New Guinea: At least eight dead after major rioting and looting|"At least eight people have died after major rioting and unrest hit Papua New Guinea's capital, Port Moresby.Shops and cars were set on fire and supermarkets looted after police went on strike over a pay dispute. The absence of police on Wednesday encouraged people from the city's outskirts to ransack shops and cause wider destruction, locals told the BBC.It follows wider tensions in Papua New Guinea over rising costs and high unemployment.Prime Minister James Marape addressed the nation on Thursday apologising for the incident, but saying lawlessness would not be tolerated.""Breaking the law does not achieve certain outcomes,"" he told the public.While most of the violence had been curbed by Wednesday evening, after soldiers were deployed and police resumed duty, Mr Marape acknowledged that the situation was ""still tense"".The Port Moresby General Hospital had confirmed eight deaths in the capital, while another seven people were reported to have died in the city of Lae, Papua New Guinea's second largest.""We have seen unprecedented level of strife in our city, something that has never happened before in the history of our city and our country,"" National Capital District Governor Powes Parkop said in a radio address on Wednesday, according to a Reuters report. He said the looting had largely been carried out by ""opportunists"". Some violence was also recorded to have been carried out by police demonstrators.The unrest was triggered after police and other public servants staged a protest strike outside parliament on Wednesday, after discovering their pay had been reduced by up to 50% in their latest pay-check.In response, Prime Minister James Marape said the pay cut was an error due to a computer glitch - which had deducted up to $100 (£78) from the pay-checks of public servants. He said the administrative error would be corrected at next month's payments.But this answer was not accepted by many protesters, some of whom then tried to push into the parliament - with footage showing people torching a car outside the Prime Minister's compound and overrunning a gate.Many touted theories from social media that the government was raising income taxes- an assertion denied by the government.""Social media picked up on this wrong information, misinformation,"" said Mr Marape, according to the New York Times, adding that people had taken advantage of police being off the streets.Port Moresby local, Maholopa Laveil, told the BBC opportunists ransacked the city, setting many buildings and small shopping centres on fire and stealing cars. The worst of the violence happened during the day.""We had a lot of fear for people who were working in the shopping centres and offices - there was a lot of glee and excitement from the people who were attacking and entering the shops,"" he said.Mr Laveil, who is an economic lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea, also said most of the people looting appeared to be from the poorer settlements outside the city.""They had come on when they heard the police had stood down and were not policing the city. ""These are suburbs with really poor people, who don't have jobs and who contribute to a lot of crime and lawlessness in the city. Many have suffered a lot from not being employed- inflation pressures - and they came out in numbers trying to get what they could from the shops nearest to them,"" he said.Ambulance officials said they had attended to several shooting injuries, while the US embassy reported shots near its compound.The Chinese embassy has also lodged a complaint with the PNG government, saying several Chinese businesses were attacked and a number of Chinese nationals injured - though they did not specify how many. ""The Chinese Embassy in Papua New Guinea has lodged solemn representations with the Papua New Guinea side over the attacks on the Chinese shops,"" the embassy said on WeChat.Australia, a neighbouring and major security partner for PNG, on Thursday called for calm in the country. Mr Marape, who met with Australia's leader last month, has yet to ask for peacekeeping help from the country.Amid an economic slump in his country that has seen higher inflation and unemployment rates, the prime minister has faced increased pressure and public resentment from many groups in society. The political opposition has also been working on a motion to cast a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, scheduled for February.""Households are doing it tough, there's growing inequality within urban centres particularly the capital city and we've got a growing number of settlements and high crime rates,""  Mr Laveil said.""All of those factors contributed to a perfect storm."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D68/production/_132265218_gettyimages-1913170125.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Frances Mao|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67942289?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Somalia conflict: UN helicopter and passengers seized by al-Shabab|"The Somali armed Islamist group al-Shabab has seized a United Nations helicopter, along with about eight people, both passengers and crew, local sources have told the BBC. The helicopter landed in territory held by the group in central Somalia.The UN's mission in Somalia (Unsom) confirmed an ""aviation incident"" involving a UN-contracted helicopter conducting a medical evacuation.It did not mention al-Shabab, but said ""response efforts are under way"".A UN memo on the incident seen by AFP news agency says the helicopter crash-landed about 70km (43 miles) southeast of Dhusamareb and no UN staff were on board. The personnel were third-party contractors, the report said. The nationalities of those on board have not been specified, nor the exact number involved. One passenger was reportedly killed and two others fled.Al-Shabab controls large parts of southern and central Somalia.The group is affiliated to al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continentThe seizure of the helicopter was confirmed to the BBC by Galmudug region Security Minister Mohamed Abdi Adan.Several foreigners and two locals were on the helicopter, Somali military official Major Hassan Ali told Reuters news agency.""It was also carrying medical supplies and it was supposed to transport injured soldiers from Galgudud region,"" he was quoted as saying. The helicopter was heading to Wisil town near the frontlines of an offensive against al-Shabab by government forces when it landed.The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) posted on social media on Wednesday night that the aircraft was ""not a WFP or UN Humanitarian Air Service craft and no WFP personnel were aboard"".The WFP added that as a precaution, its flights in the area had been temporarily suspended.The Somali government has in recent months intensified its fight against the al-Qaeda-linked group.Are militant attacks on the rise in Somalia?The men in sarongs taking on al-Shabab militantsRare access to Somalia's US-funded 'lightning' brigade"|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15D98/production/_132269498_alqq.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|no writer|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67934609?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
'Deep concern' for patients and staff at Gaza's al-Aqsa hospital|"Doctors from the UK who have been working at what they say is the only functioning hospital in the central Gaza Strip have told the BBC of their ""deep concern"" for patients and staff remaining there - as fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas has reportedly intensified in nearby areas.Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks.At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity.""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC.When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there.""Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"".The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"".He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"".""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday.""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave.""Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"".Blinken: Cost of war on Gaza's children far too highAl Jazeera journalist's son killed in GazaIsraeli-Palestinian bitterness deepened by Hamas attack and warAnother doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days.""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details.And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added.The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The BBC has asked the IDF for comment.The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing.Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital.The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves.Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone.The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa.Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital.""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday.""He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital.""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.""Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital.The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital.""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating.""""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. ""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added.Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold.""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity.""She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief.""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said.""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor.""Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries.""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged.""The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. ""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned.Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them.The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FE/production/_132266938_baby.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Alys Davies|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67929397?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Illegal New York synagogue tunnel leads to 9 arrests|"Nine members of a New York Hasidic Jewish community have been arrested and charged over a secret tunnel that connected to a historic synagogue. They fought police after city officials and leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters came to close the tunnel.The men are charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and obstructing governmental administration.A spokesperson for the Chabad called them a ""group of extremist students"".The tunnels were built under a prominent street in Brooklyn, where the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters are located. The building is one of the most significant Jewish sites in the city. City inspectors were called to the Chabad on Monday to conduct an emergency structural inspection. There were looming concerns that the illegal tunnel could have caused damage to the famous property. A brawl broke out after police found a group of young men blocking efforts to inspect and fill the tunnel with cement. Some of the men then broke through the wall of the prayer space. Those acts led to the arrests. Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, the chairman of the Chabad, thanked police for their efforts and said the community was ""pained by the vandalism of a group of young agitators"".""These odious actions will be investigated, and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored,"" he said. It is unclear who built the tunnel, how they did it and what their motivations were. It appears the tunnel connects to at least one other building on the street in Brooklyn.One local told the New York Times that the men sought to build the tunnel to hasten the expansion of the synagogue.   Some members who have attended services and functions at the Chabad have reportedly complained about overcrowding in the building in recent years. Videos and photos from inside the building on Monday, however, showed a small group of mostly young men trying to block the tunnel from being filled with cement. Others were seen pulling wood panels from the walls of the sanctuary and using benches to block police in the videos and images. One of the videos reviewed by the BBC showed an officer using a spray to break up a growing skirmish. The building, which sees thousands of visitors each year, was formerly the home of the leader of the Orthodox Jewish movement - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.The rabbi is credited with leading the Chabad-Lubavitch and revitalising the Hasidic religious community after it was devastated in the Holocaust. He died in 1994, but his headquarters remains a well-known centre for the Jewish religion. While the Chabad-Lubavitcher movement is sprawling and its mission is to welcome Jews at all levels of religious practice, it also has key divisions within the larger movement. Those divisions appeared to have spilled over in the tunnel dispute at 770 Eastern Parkway this month.A deeply religious fringe group within the Chabad believes Rabbi Schneerson is the Jewish Messiah - an idea the mainstream movement rejects. That disagreement is reportedly an element in the tunnel altercation.The building has been closed as inspection of the tunnels has continued.

Five dead as storm brings floods to US north-east|"A powerful winter storm has left five people dead and rivers dangerously swollen after barrelling through the eastern US.Flood warnings were in effect for parts of New York and New Jersey until Thursday. More than 150,000 households had no power on Wednesday evening, with New York state and Pennsylvania worst hit. Officials warned some rivers could still burst their banks in the next two days in parts of the north-east.The heavy rainfall has led to road closures and dozens of flood warnings in the region.  Officials have urged people to move their cars away from rising rivers in New Jersey, as the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued multiple flood warnings in the state.""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads,"" the NWS said in an advisory on Wednesday, cautioning that ""most flood deaths occur in vehicles"". In Connecticut, officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents along the Yantic River on Wednesday due to flood risk, adding that people may be displaced for several days.And in Annapolis, Maryland, residents were forced to use kayaks to navigate through record floodwaters. Annapolis resident Kelsi Furman told the BBC's US news partner CBS that the water had risen beyond the city's seawall. ""Kind of alarming to see,"" she said. ""I didn't realise how crazy it gets.""Many school districts on the East Coast cancelled classes or opened later on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the weather. Nearly 700 flights were cancelled on Wednesday and almost 4,000 were delayed, with New York City's airports most affected. The NWS has warned that severe weather could return later this week as a storm lopes into the Great Lakes region over Friday and Saturday.This system, the agency said, will bring with it up to 4in (10cm) of snowfall from south-east Nebraska to Michigan. It will be coupled with a cold Arctic front, forecasters added, which may bring about strong blizzard conditions. A string of tornadoes rolled through several south-eastern US states on Tuesday, including Florida, Alabama and Georgia.Among the fatalities was an 81-year-old woman in Alabama who was reportedly killed after a tornado ripped through Houston County, destroying mobile homes and motorhomes.

Eurovision: Finnish artists want Israel barred from contest over Gaza war|"More than 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have signed a petition urging a ban on Israel from Eurovision over alleged ""war crimes"" in Gaza.If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition.Yle says it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organiser of the contest.Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv.Lukas Korpelainen, one of the petition's authors, told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was not acceptable for Israel to ""take part in the Eurovision Song Contest to polish its image"".Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest.They accuse Yle of double standards, saying the broadcaster was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, ""and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well"".A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was ""contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent"".The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating.Mr Vilén said the situation in Israel and Gaza was ""not quite the same"".""As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine,"" he told Finnish tabloid Ilta-Sanomat last month.Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters.Yle also plans to meet the petition's authors.Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?In December the EBU released a statement saying that Eurovision was ""for broadcasters - not for governments"" and Israel had taken part for 50 years.It said member organisations had agreed that Israel's public broadcaster ""complies with all competition rules"" and insisted the contest was a ""non-political event"".The BBC has approached Israel's culture ministry and public broadcaster Kan for comment.This year's Eurovision will take place in the Swedish city of Malmö, with the United Kingdom represented by pop star Olly Alexander.After it emerged that Alexander had endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide, an Israeli official told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"".More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage.Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages.A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"".According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108D/production/_132273240_6fa22a2163b79eca476f9583a2aa1f2fba574217.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Phelan Chatterjee|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67941086?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Israel-Gaza war: Blinken says cost of conflict on children far too high|"The cost of war on Gaza's civilians is ""far too high"", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mr Blinken said Israel needed to remove barriers so more essential aid could be allowed into Gaza.But he said Israel faced a huge challenge in fighting an enemy in Hamas which had embedded itself within the civilian population.Mr Blinken was speaking after meeting Israeli leaders on his fourth trip to the country since the conflict began.America's top diplomat told a news conference in Tel Aviv that leaders in the region shared US concerns about the ""dire humanitarian situation"" on the ground. But he said he had heard a new and powerful message from Israel's neighbours over the last three days. They are willing not only to live with Israel but to integrate the region in a way that makes everyone secure, including Israel, Mr Blinken said. In other words, talk of diplomatic normalisation with Israel - which had appeared to be derailed by the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - is on the table.That, he said, would require some hard decisions and hard choices - which include Israel agreeing to a ""clear pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state"" which he said was vital for long-term peace. Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether this was something Israel would consider. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously voiced his staunch opposition to such a state, citing security concerns. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a cross-border assault by Hamas - designated a terrorist organisation by Israel and many western nations including the US. 1,300 people were killed in the attacks.Since then, more than 23,200 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Israel's border residents in fear of invasion from northSaudi Arabia interested in Israel deal after warWhen asked about whether there was any evidence that Israel was de-escalating its military campaign in Gaza, Mr Blinken answered that no one in the region - including the Israelis - wanted the conflict to escalate. That may be reassuring for many worried about the conflict spreading, but he gave no indication that Israel told him it was winding down its military operations anytime soon. In recent weeks, Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based organisation designated a terrorist group by the US, has increased rocket fire into northern Israel.Yemeni Houthi rebels have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea - one of the world's most important trading routes. The Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. Mr Blinken's meetings in Israel on Tuesday were not entirely without tangible results. He announced that the US and Israel agreed on a plan for the UN to conduct an ""assessment mission"" that would be the first step toward allowing Palestinians to return to the areas of northern Gaza that have been devastated by the Israeli offensive.Even here, however, Mr Blinken warned that their return would not happen ""overnight"". Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place.Mr Blinken also told the press conference that South African claims that Israel was committing genocide, filed at the International Court of Justice, were ""meritless"".But he said: ""The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high.""He cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: ""For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences."" ""More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza. And then once they're in Gaza, they need to get more effectively to the people who need them."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AD30/production/_132263344_anthonyzurcher.png|2024-01-09 00:00:00|By James Gregory & Anthony Zurcher |https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67929616?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Saudi Arabia interested in Israel normalisation deal after war|"Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK says it is interested in normalising relations with Israel after the war in Gaza, but that any deal must lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.Prince Khalid bin Bandar told the BBC a pact was ""close"" when the the kingdom paused US-brokered talks after Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel on 7 October.Saudi Arabia still believed in establishing ties with Israel despite the ""deplorable"" casualty figures in Gaza, he said, but it would not ""come at the cost of the Palestinian people"".The ambassador also warned that there was a ""failure of humanity"" over Gaza, with the international community not doing enough to end the fighting.He also said he would like to see the UK ""moderate it's position"" and ""treat Israel the same way it treats everyone else"". ""The blind spot towards Israel is a real problem because it provides a blind spot to peace,"" he added.Saudi-Israel deal getting closer, prince saysPalestinians set out terms for Saudi-Israeli dealSaudi Arabia is a leader of the Arab and Islamic world. It has never formally recognised Israel since its creation in 1948, and a deal normalising ties would represent a major breakthrough for the Jewish state.In late September, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler had declared in a US television interview that ""every day we get closer"" to an agreement.While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Palestinian issue was ""very important"" and that any agreement would have to ""ease the life of the Palestinians"", he did not declare that it would be dependent on advances towards the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The public position of Palestinian leaders is that they will reject outright a deal if it does not leave them with a state, but earlier that month officials had said they were privately demanding a cash boost and more control of land in the occupied West Bank in return for engaging with the US-backed Saudi-Israel process. Saudi officials reportedly asked the US to pause the three-way discussions a few days after the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage by hundreds of Hamas gunmen who infiltrated southern Israeli communities from Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 23,200 people have been killed in the territory during the military campaign that Israel subsequently launched with the aim of destroying Hamas.After meeting Crown Prince Mohammed on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters he had brought up the subject of normalisation.""There's a clear interest here in pursuing that,"" he said. ""But it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state.""In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday, the Saudi ambassador in London confirmed that ""absolutely there is interest"" among his country's leaders for an agreement.""[A deal] was close, there is no question. For us, the final end point definitely included nothing less than an independent state of Palestine. So, while we still - going forward after 7 October - believe in normalisation, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people,"" Prince Khalid said.He added: ""We were close to normalisation, therefore close to a Palestinian state. One doesn't come without the other. The sequencing, how it is managed, that is what was being discussed.""Asked if Saudi Arabia saw Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western countries - as part of that future Palestinian state, Prince Khalid said it ""requires a lot of thought"".""There is always room for change if you have optimism and hope. But when there is a conflict the first thing you have to recognise is that both sides have lost,"" he added.""The problem that we have today with the current government in Israel is there is an extreme, absolutist perspective which does not work to achieve compromise and therefore you are never going to end the conflict.""He did not elaborate, but two far-right Israeli ministers were denounced by the US after they recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza.Prince Khalid also warned that there was a risk of radicalisation as a result of the war, which has not only left many thousands of civilians dead in Gaza but also caused widespread devastation and a deep humanitarian crisis.""The unprecedented level of the violence that has been carried out by both sides - but in particular by what is meant to be a responsible state in Israel - over the past three months, I don't think I have seen anything like it in my life,"" he said. ""The numbers are deplorable, absolutely deplorable.""""That is going to create a lack of hope amongst not just the Palestinian people, but disaffected people [across the world]. All see a failure of humanity in what is happening, because nobody has done anything to stop it. Efforts are being made, but it is not enough."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/115A3/production/_132257017_104148b5d5c3af7636f0b272f57ccf0c0477f773.jpg|2024-01-09 00:00:00|By David Gritten|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67922238?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
'I cannot sleep in peace' - Israelis fearful as Hezbollah tensions soar|"Efrat Eldan Schechter is a native of the Northern Galilee and never even considered moving anywhere else to bring up her family - that is until the events of 7 October.  When she heard and watched reports of what was happening in southern Israel that morning, as heavily armed Hamas gunmen streamed out of Gaza, she was immediately taken back to stories from the ""Yom Kippur"" or 1973 Middle East war, when Israel was attacked simultaneously on two fronts. ""I was terrified. Everyone was sleeping in and I thought it's going to be '73 all over again and Hezbollah is coming for us too,"" says Efrat, as our interview in her front garden is punctuated by the regular loud thud of outgoing Israeli artillery fire.""Immediately, I woke everyone up and very quickly got everything together and drove to a relative's house in the centre of Israel.""Suspected Israeli strike kills Hezbollah commander'We are not afraid of war' Hezbollah warns IsraelHamas leader's assassination sparks wider war fearsAfter a month the family returned to their house near Kiryat Shmona, frustrated because they're still living on the edge of a war zone - a ""buffer zone"" as Efrat calls it - well within range of Hezbollah rockets being fired from southern Lebanon. ""What we fear most is that nothing will be done because Hezbollah are just waiting there on the border to come in and invade Israel,"" says the mother-of-three. ""I cannot sleep in peace. I want my government to make sure that we have real security here. If it is necessary, they should act and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon.""Ever since violence here erupted on 8 October, when Hezbollah fired rockets and artillery ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinians, and Israel fired back, clashes in the north are generally confined to a three- or four-mile-wide (5-6km) strip along the entire border. But they are intense and deadly - nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed in Israel, officials say, while authorities in Lebanon have reported that 123 people have been killed, including at least 21 civilians. The frontier communities of northern Israel are today like ghost towns. More than 80,000 residents have been evacuated to centres further south, but Nissan Zeevi is one of the few who has stayed. The businessman, and civil defence member, shows me around his kibbutz - Kfar Giladi, just north of Kiryat Shmona. The scenery is beguiling as you look out over the lush, green Hula valley and Mount Hermon in the distance, but this border has always been volatile.Like Efrat, Nissan does not believe most people can return to their homes and businesses until there is a guarantee of a lasting peace. He is particularly frustrated that UN Security Council resolution 1701, which helped end the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah has not been fully implemented. Crucially, says Nissan, 1701 calls for the demilitarisation of armed groups (specifically Hezbollah) in southern Lebanon. And that, clearly, has not been achieved.Nissan is part of Lobby 1701, which has called for the implementation of the resolution ""whether through diplomatic means or through a military action by Israel"".""What we are demanding from our government is to take care of Hezbollah, to demolish the threat coming from those areas of southern Lebanon,"" he tells me, as he points out the many Lebanese villages he can see from his own home and from where, he says, much of the incoming fire emanates.When I ask him if he would support even more action by the Israeli government in southern Lebanon, Nissan says: ""Absolutely! It's not only me. A big proportion of the population of Israel is demanding the same."" ""If we don't do this, we will end up with another 7 October,"" he adds.Last month, I travelled to those very same frontier villages in southern Lebanon. They're being hit daily by strikes because Israel says Hezbollah is hiding in communities to launch rockets and sophisticated weapons. Just as on the Israeli side, tens of thousands of people have left these areas too, and many have been killed. There's loss on both sides of the border.The possibility that this ""contained"" border conflict will escalate into a full-scale war came even closer on Monday with the apparent assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander, Wissam Tawil, when his car was hit in an air strike in Khirbet Selim. Last week, it is widely believed that Israel was also responsible for a drone strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, that killed Hamas's deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri.None of this is good news for those trying to make a living near the front line. Farmer Ofer ""Poshko"" Moskovitz of Kibbutz Misgav Am can't bring in the kibbutz's valuable avocado crop because the Israeli army says it's too dangerous for him to spend time in his orchards, which are right up against the Lebanese border, north-west of Kiryat Shmona. But, unlike many I spoke to in the north, this phlegmatic and jovial farmer does think a wider war can be averted.""I'm not worried, because Israel is a strong country,"" says Ofer as we wade our way through hundreds upon hundreds of almost ripe, green avocados strewn across the ground. He continues: ""Nobody is looking for war here. We prefer to do it in a diplomatic way and they are looking for a solution - both the army and diplomatic efforts together.""Ofer's cautious positivity is in short supply in these parts.   Sarit Zahavi, who also lives close to the border, is the founder of the Alma Research Institute in northern Israel and spends much of her time analysing political developments among Israel's regional neighbours.""We are facing a very dangerous situation, in the sense that if there is to be a diplomatic arrangement, it would mean a ceasefire. And everybody will think that is good news,"" she tells me.""But, for me, if there will be a ceasefire, nobody will enforce the arrangement. Then Hezbollah will continue to grow, and will continue to develop its capabilities to invade Israel.""Fewer people, at least in northern Israel, seem to be confident that diplomacy can now avert a wider war. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has already vowed to retaliate for Israel's actions and, Israel too, seems to be preparing for the possibility of an escalation. On Monday, Israel carried out some of the heaviest bombing so far along its northern border just as the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv. With the devastating war in Gaza and the latest developments in the north, the challenge for Secretary Blinken seems almost impossible.

Antony Blinken: On the US mission to stop Gaza igniting wider war|"Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver. His main mission on this trip is to ensure the Israel-Gaza war does not spread into a regional conflict.As he flies between destinations in southwest Asia - a packed schedule that includes stops in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel - there is ample evidence, however, that the cauldron of tensions in the region is on the verge of boiling over.Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on civilian shipping in the Red Sea, bringing traffic through that key international waterway to a near halt. The US has warned that it will defend its interests. If the rebels persist, and the disruption to global commerce continues, an American military response may be inevitable - a development that would unnerve some key American Arab allies.""We never see a military action as a resolution,"" said the Qatari prime minister in a joint press conference with Mr Blinken in Doha on Sunday. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said his biggest worry was that such action would ""keep us in a loop that will never end and will create a real tension in the entire region"".On Saturday, Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon fired a barrage of rocket attacks on northern Israel in reprisal for what appeared to be an Israeli-planned bomb attack that killed a key Hamas leader in Beirut. Israel responded with air strikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.Huge challenges for Israel on its vague ‘day after’ Gaza planHow Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 OctoberAn escalation there, Mr Blinken said later that day, was a ""real concern"". He called on regional powers with influence over Hezbollah - in other words Iran and, to a lesser extent, Turkey - to use their influence to ""try to keep things in check"".That may be difficult. As the Washington Post reported, American officials are concerned that Israel may be considering a more expansive offensive against Hezbollah.""We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement, but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday.Meanwhile, US military installations have been hit by rocket and drone attacks from militants in Iraq and Syria, where more than 3,000 American soldiers are stationed. In late October, a drone breached US defences and struck a barracks but did not detonate, according to a Reuters report, narrowly avoiding what might have been significant American casualties. The US has responded with military action, including an air strike in Baghdad last week that killed Mushtaq Taleb al-Saidi, an Iran-backed militia leader.Each of these episodes, taken individually, presents a threat to regional stability. When viewed as a whole, it suggests a Middle East teetering on the brink of wider war.In Qatar on Sunday, Mr Blinken said the US has a plan to address the growing instability - and it hinges on winding down the Israeli military campaign in Gaza and working with Arab nations and the Israelis to establish a ""durable"" peace for the Palestinians.""The United States has a vision for how to get there, a regional approach that delivers lasting security for Israel and a state for the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""And my takeaway from the discussions so far ... is that our partners are willing to have these difficult conversations and to make hard decisions.""Therein lies the rub. After meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, Mr Blinken said he's seen a willingness to help stabilise and revitalise a post-war Gaza among all the leaders he's spoken with so far. But the US has to get Israel on board. The timing of Mr Blinken's latest Middle East trip may give hints of the American strategy in this latest round of shuttle diplomacy. His early visits to Turkey and Arab nations before two days in Israel have allowed the secretary to take the temperature of regional players before sitting down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet.Then the ball, as Americans like to say, is in the Israeli court.""I'll have an opportunity to share with Israeli leaders everything I've heard thus far on this trip,"" he said on Monday. ""I'm convinced that there is a future path that can actually bring lasting peace and security for Israel.""Behind all this is an American gamble - that resolving, or at least winding down, the Gaza War will cool tensions throughout the region. It is a bet that the various mini-crises - in the Red Sea, in Lebanon, and in Iraq and Syria - have not taken on a momentum of their own.There is no peace in the region without a legitimate, peaceful solution to the Palestinian conflict, the Qatari prime minister said on Sunday. The question is, will there be peace with such a resolution?During his November trip to the Middle East, Mr Blinken told reporters gathered on the tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, that countries across the region do not want war - and are working to prevent the conflict from spreading.""Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is,"" the US secretary said. Since then, there has been ample evidence that while a wider war may not be wanted, the prospects for one has increased - despite the stated intentions and efforts of Mr Blinken and the Americans."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4710/production/_132229181_blinken_976getty.jpg|2024-01-08 00:00:00|By Anthony Zurcher|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67911825?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Israel-Palestinian bitterness deepened by Hamas attack and war|"Even as war rages on in Gaza, causing huge loss of life, a recent survey suggests there is wide support among Palestinians for Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel which triggered it. Meanwhile, most Israelis are not focused on the killing of Palestinian civilians and back their country's military offensive to crush Hamas and bring home hostages, polls suggest.Three months into the deadliest round of fighting in the decades-old conflict here, I have been asking Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem for their views.Serving frothy coffees in the winter sunshine, the cafeterias in the west of the city are bustling. But for Israelis, the war raging in Gaza is a constant worry.""It's always on our mind, we have many friends with children and relatives who are [soldiers] there in Gaza, and we pray for them a lot,"" says Edna, a religious Jewish woman from Bnei Brak.""Just yesterday we visited the son of a friend who was very injured. They don't know if he will lose both his legs.  By God's will, he won't,"" she says.""And we keep on thinking about the hostages. It's like a piece of us is in there.""The attacks of the 7th of October killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel. More than 100 of the 240 hostages who were snatched and taken to Gaza remain in captivity.Meanwhile, Israel's air and ground assaults in the Palestinian territory have killed about 23,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been forced to flee their homes amid widespread destruction.Yet, last week, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) found that two-thirds of Israelis did not think Israel should agree to demands from the US to shift to a phase of the war that reduces heavy bombing in densely populated areas. ""People who want to see what is happening in Gaza can see it via the internet,"" says leading IDI pollster, Professor Tamar Hermann, referring to the human suffering. ""But the media is not bringing to our living rooms the same images as people see in Europe or other states in the world.""She adds that scenes of Gazan civilians celebrating the 7th of October assault undermined public sympathy in Israel.""Unlike in previous military operations, the civilians are not perceived here as innocent bystanders. The sympathy is quite low,"" Prof Hermann says. Heading towards the Old City, I find Tzafir Bracha who has come for a visit. He is staying with relatives and is one of tens of thousands of Israelis, most of them evacuated, from southern Israel who has not returned home for three months. He is still reeling with the shock of what happened.""I think it'll take time for everybody to understand how big this event was [on 7th of October] and what a catastrophe it was. I think most of us are still licking our wounds,"" he tells me. ""I think that nobody can understand this unless it happened to them.""Tzafir believes the world should see that Hamas must be defeated so it is no longer a threat.""We have to have a victory. You have to find the people that caused this and take them [away] from society and only then can you really have peace,"" he says.In the narrow streets of the Old City, many Palestinians from the occupied East of Jerusalem tell me they feel restricted in what they can say publicly. Many point out how social media posts are often monitored by Israel.  But everyone I meet is following the war minute by minute.""I am on Instagram, on X. I follow people from Gaza,"" says Haneen, a student nurse. ""We all feel so sad."" But she tells me she doubts Israel's official version of what happened on the 7th of October.  ""We know as Palestinians that Israel used propaganda, so we don't believe what they say. We know there is some part that's right, but other parts are not right.""Her position is common among Palestinians, according to the latest poll carried out in the occupied West Bank and Gaza by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.""The overwhelming majority of the Palestinians do not believe Hamas has committed any atrocities, the overwhelming majority has not seen any videos that show atrocities. Of course, these videos are out there,"" says Professor Khalil Shikaki, who oversaw the poll.His research found increased support for Hamas, mostly in the West Bank, although a majority of Palestinians still do not back the armed group, seen by Israel, the UK and many Western countries as a terrorist organisation.Most notably, in the survey, 72% of the Palestinian public believed that Hamas's decision to launch its offensive on 7th October was correct.A Palestinian shop owner who does not want to give his name tries to explain the reasoning. He accuses foreign media of ignoring the broader context of the long years of blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after Hamas took over in 2007 and the tough living conditions it created.""People in Gaza have been living in a big prison,"" he tells me. Now he despairs of the international community because it is not doing more to stop the fighting.""We see difficult things on the TV. Very difficult. Children get killed. Women get killed. Old people get killed with no reason. They didn't do anything. It's unbelievable,"" the shopkeeper says.  ""Honestly, I don't imagine, how could people be watching these kind of things and they have the power to stop these things?  They are watching a Hollywood movie? It's like nothing [to them]?""In Jerusalem, there is a lot that divides the Israelis and Palestinians I have been speaking to.  However, most now share a deeper mutual mistrust and a common fear about what the months ahead have in store.  There is also a strong feeling on both sides that people around the globe do not understand their pain and suffering."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F9BB/production/_132213936_thumbnail_gettyimages-1874989800.jpg|2024-01-07 00:00:00|By Yolande Knell|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67893122?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Israel-Gaza war: The huge challenges facing Israel's 'day after' plan|"When Hamas attacked Israel, almost exactly three months ago, Israel was unprepared.It didn't see the attack coming, struggled to contain it at first and then launched a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip with only the bare bones of a plan: to destroy Hamas.Beyond that, there was a yawning vacuum. But that's beginning to change.As outlined to reporters on Thursday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's plan for ""the day after"" is little more than a series of bullet points, but they're worth examining.On security, he doesn't really say anything Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't already - Israel will ""reserve its operational freedom of action"" throughout the Gaza Strip, and make sure that no-one poses a threat to Israel.It's when the plan touches on what it calls ""the four corners of the civilian square"" that things get a little blurry.Israel's rigid control over the entry of goods into the Gaza Strip - a fact of life for the past two decades - would continue.Israel, Egypt and the United States would work together on ways to secure the porous border between Egypt and Gaza - something that would involve solving the problem of tunnels once and for all.But the plan envisages a major role for foreign players - the US, plus European and Arab governments - in the creation of a ""multinational task force"" with responsibility for what's euphemistically called ""the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip"".In other words, those countries will be expected to put the whole shattered area back together. And pay for it.For countries, the EU and Gulf States in particular, which have seen their previous investments - hospitals, schools and universities - blown to smithereens over the past three months, it is hardly a tempting prospect.Even assuming Israel succeeds in its goal of eliminating Hamas as a threat, who is to say violence won't erupt in the future, triggering yet another round of costly destruction?The tireless US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is on his latest visit to the region - his fourth since 7 October. As he travels from one Arab capital to another, how much enthusiasm is he likely to encounter from leaders appalled at the scenes of suffering inflicted on Gaza?Until now, the Arab view has been that until there's a ceasefire and the war's devastating humanitarian consequences have been properly addressed, it's impossible to talk about ""the day after"".But writing for the British think tank Chatham House, Dr Sanam Vakil and Dr Neil Quilliam urge Arab governments not to wait.""Without serious regional planning and investment in Gaza,"" they write, ""a potential outcome that could materialize is lawlessness and a Palestinian political vacuum alongside the grim reality of famine, disease and death.""And what of that ""Palestinian political vacuum""?In Mr Gallant's ""four corners"" plan, the Palestinian component is perhaps the vaguest.""The entity controlling the territory,"" it says, ""will build on the capabilities of the existing administrative mechanism (civil committees) in Gaza - local non-hostile actors.""According to media reports, all appointments to local committees would have to be approved by Israel.There's no role for Hamas, obviously, but also none - for now at least - for the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, and its president Mahmoud Abbas.For Palestinians, the plan has echoes of a fleeting Israeli effort, in the late 1970s, to promote non-political ""Village Leagues"" to run local affairs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip (and thus reduce the influence of the Palestine Liberation Organisation).""Israel cannot conceive of an idea where Palestinians have political agency,"" says Amjad Iraqi, senior editor at the independent Israeli +972 Magazine.""They're basically trying to replicate in Gaza the model they have in the West Bank, but with someone that isn't an organised political faction.""Employing local committees composed of Gaza notables would also have the effect of politically separating the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.Palestinians have long been wary of what they see as a deliberate Israeli policy of divide and rule, aimed in part at preventing the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.The West Bank and Gaza may have been physically separate since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, but Palestinians regard both territories as integral parts of their national identity and will fiercely resist any attempt to sever that connection.""Gaza is not a separate country,"" says the Palestinian analyst and former PA spokeswoman Nour Odeh. ""They have the same aspirations for statehood and freedom from Israeli control and occupation.""US officials, who say they are still examining the Gallant plan (and who point out that it's not yet an official Israeli proposal) don't seem very enthusiastic.For weeks, the Biden administration has been insisting that there should be a role for the Palestinian Authority, in the teeth of opposition from Mr Netanyahu, who argues that the PA has disqualified itself through its failure to condemn Hamas's 7 October attacks.Travelling with Mr Blinken, a senior State Department official said the US still wanted to see the PA ruling over the Palestinian territories - meaning the West Bank and Gaza Strip.He also said it would be hard for the US to get Arab partners to agree to work with Israel when some members of Mr Netanyahu's government were openly calling for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza.This remains the biggest Palestinian fear, fuelled by fiery rhetoric from some of Mr Netanyahu's political allies and policy documents from obscure parts of the government.In recent days, those fears have been stoked by reports that the government has been conducting secret negotiations with African countries to accept migrants from Gaza.With a large proportion of Gaza's civilian population now crammed into the southern part of the Strip, some of them having moved multiple times since 7 October, the thought that they might be forced to seek sanctuary outside Gaza - with no certainty of being able to return - is profoundly alarming.But it's not just the Palestinians who are sceptical about Mr Gallant's plan. Some of the most vociferous opposition is already coming from hardline members of Mr Netanyahu's own fractious coalition. Some of them believe it was a fundamental mistake for Israel to pull out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. The only way to guarantee security, they argue, is for Israel to reoccupy the whole area and allow Jewish settlers to return.On this, Mr Gallant seems pretty blunt.""There will be no Israeli civilian presence in the Gaza Strip.""But for the hardliners, rebuilding Gaza and allowing the Palestinians to stay is merely storing up trouble. ""We will go back to October the 7th, maybe in two years, five years, 10 years,"" says Ohad Tal, an MP from the hardline Religious Zionist Party. ""Allowing money from the world to flood into Gaza to rebuild the houses basically means they will take all the money and as before, instead of building Gaza into a Singapore, they made it into the biggest terror nest in the world.""The widely reported bust up in Thursday night's cabinet meeting, over the separate but related matter of when and how the Israeli military should examine the circumstances surrounding the 7 October attacks, was a powerful demonstration of the sharp divisions within Mr Netanyahu's government. Those divisions are only likely to deepen as Israel - and the world - grapple with what to do with Gaza when this war finally ends.  Stakes are immense as Biden presses Israel to change courseHamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoidedThe status quo is smashed.

Israeli ex-hostage returns to site of Nova festival massacre and kidnappings|"Exactly three months ago this weekend, Eynav Levy and her husband Or were in a hurry. It was just after six o'clock in the morning and they were late in arriving at the Nova Music Festival, in the woods near Kibbutz Re'im, because they'd wanted to spend another night with their two-year old son Almog.Within a matter of hours, Eynav had been shot dead by Hamas gunmen and Or was abducted and taken to Gaza.Now Or's brother, Michael, has come back to the Nova site for the first time. He says it's the hardest thing he's ever done apart from explaining to his little nephew Almog that ""his mother won't come back and his father is missing"" and that they are looking for him.  ""I feel we feel are living someone else's life. It's like a horror movie,"" he tells me. ""It doesn't feel like our lives. I haven't slept for more than three hours straight in 91 days. I barely eat, I just do this.""For him, life was turned upside down on 7 October.""There was the old Michael prior to 7 October, and there's the new Michael. Now. Those are two different people,"" he adds.He wants Israel's government to prioritise the release of hostages. ""We want them back now. That's it. They need to bring them back as soon as possible. That was the request on day one, and that's the request on day 91. And it's not going to change until they are back.""It's thought that more than 130 hostages still remain in Gaza, although some are known to have died. More than 100 hostages, mainly women and children, were released by Hamas in November before a temporary halt in fighting broke down. Among them is 18-year-old Itay Regev, who was freed days after his wounded sister Maya was released. Itay spoke briefly, about what he'd gone through, at today's memorial event at the Nova site. ""It was important for me to be here and to speak out,"" said Itay, still visibly traumatised by his ordeal. ""I was in captivity for 54 days and every day was like forever. The conditions are very, very hard to survive. The hostages cannot remain for one more second. They all have to return home now!""The world's attention is still very much focused on the ongoing war in Gaza where Hamas-run health authorities say more than 22,000 people have been killed in Israeli bombings, many of them women and children.But Israel doesn't want the world to forget what happened across the south on 7 October. More than 360 people were killed at Nova alone - when armed Hamas fighters crossed over the border, just two kilometres to the west. The young partygoers stood no chance, the desert scrub offered very little cover in which to hide and their exit routes were blocked by heavily armed Hamas gunmen.There's very little left at the Nova Site now but that doesn't mean what happened here has been erased from memory.At a huge exhibition centre in the city of Tel Aviv, Tal Shimoni - a survivor of the Nova Festival atrocity - shows me around an incredible installation, an almost complete reproduction of the Nova site. Thousands of items including the main canopy, tents, sleeping bags, art exhibits and personal possessions have been brought here from the festival venue.There are many powerful, emotive items including several yellow, portable toilets in which revellers tried to hide but which were riddled with bullets by Hamas gunmen. Of the 30 people who tried to hide inside them, only three survived.Nearby, the main bar from the site has been rebuilt, complete with half-empty bottles, ashtrays and a bullet-damaged cash till. There are also six chest-sized drinks refrigerators. The first rescuers on the scene at Nova found many bodies in and around these fridges - more places where young people had desperately tried to hide from the gunfire. It's a moving experience to walk through the site and imagine being at the Nova festival, perhaps in the early hours before dawn when all hell descended. Music plays out from the same speaker system they had at the festival.It's also painful for Tal to show people around - while she survived physically unscathed, she's emotionally damaged and saw many people killed. But, for her, staging this exhibition is the best way to honour their memories.""My friends would want us to go out and celebrate their lives …. We will dance again,"" she says.In Israel, politicians, diplomats and military leaders are beginning to talk about 'the day after' - what will happen when the war in Gaza eventually ends. That is a step too far for the families of the hostages and something they cannot yet contemplate.The only thing left at Nova now are portraits and photographs of hundreds of partygoers who were murdered here, and of the dozens of hostages taken from here to Gaza, mounted on stakes in the desert soil.For Michael Levy, the only thing that matters now is to secure the release of the hostages. ""I have one goal, my one mission in life and it is to bring them back."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3B25/production/_132214151_a3b1cb03-1880-4f63-a077-cae8eaa408a8.jpg|2024-01-05 00:00:00|By Wyre Davies|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67893123?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza. Bar Kuperstein, 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information.Eliya Cohen, 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported.  Amit Buskila, 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza.Carmel Gat, 39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire. Dror Or, 48, was seen by a neighbour being dragged out of his home in Be'eri, according to their nephew Emmanuel Besorai, along with his son and daughter. On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam, 17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people murdered at the kibbutz, Yonat's brother told the Guardian newspaper.Tal Shoham, 38, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October.Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the ""only reasonable explanation"" is that he was taken to Gaza.Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released. Those still being held are believed to include Watchara Sriuan, 32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive. Kiattisak ""Top"" Patee and a Mr Pongtorn (no first name given) have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages. A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity. On 16 December, the Israeli military expressed ""deep remorse"" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26.The death of Tamir Adar, 38, was announced on 5 January by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Other hostages recently confirmed to have died include Gadi Haggai, Ron Scherman, Nik Beizer, Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado.Other fatalities include Sahar Baruch, 25, Dror Kaplun, 68, Aviv Atzili, 49, Arye Zalmanovich, 85, Ronen Engel, 54, Maya Goren, 56, Guy Iluz, 26, Ofir Tzarfati, 27, Ofra Keider, 70, and Eliyahu Margalit, 75. The bodies of 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano, and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.Hostages whose death has been reported, but not confirmed, include Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

McDonald's hit by Israel-Gaza 'misinformation'|"McDonald's said it was seeing a ""meaningful"" hit to business, as customers in the Middle East and elsewhere boycott the firm for its perceived support of Israel. Chief executive Chris Kempczinski acknowledged the impact in a LinkedIn post, blaming the backlash on ""misinformation"".He is the second boss of a major US firm to address the business toll sparked by Israel-Gaza war tension.Starbucks has also been affected.""Several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald's,"" Mr Kempczinski wrote in the message.""This is disheartening and ill-founded,"" he added. ""In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald's is proudly represented by local owner operators.""McDonald's relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% are located in the Middle East. Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, the McDonald's corporate headquarters has tried to keep a low profile regarding the conflict.But its brand has still been caught up in the fight.In the weeks following the attack, McDonald's Israel said it had given away thousands of free meals to members of the Israeli military. The moves sparked grassroots calls for boycotts of the brand by those angered by Israel's military response in Gaza, prompting owners in Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan to put out statements distancing themselves. The post from Mr Kempczinski comes as tensions over the boycotts have escalated in recent days. The pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), which had not formally targeted McDonald's, this week officially called for a boycott of the brand.The move came after McDonald's Malaysia, which is backed by a Saudi firm, sued the Malaysia BDS group for $1.3m (£1m), citing ""false and defamatory statements"" that it said had hurt its business. BDS said McDonald's should cut ties with its franchisee in Israel - and in Malaysia, unless it dropped the lawsuit. ""Instead of pressuring its parent company, McDonald's Corporation, to terminate its shameful franchise agreement in Israel, McDonald's Malaysia and its Saudi owner are desperately trying to silence voices of peaceful solidarity with the Palestinian liberation struggle in Malaysia,"" the group said. ""We cannot let this pass. Let's show McDonald's what grassroots boycotts can do.""McDonald's declined to comment on the lawsuit, referring back to the post. In his message, Mr Kempczinski said: ""We abhor violence of any kind and firmly stand against hate speech, and we will always proudly open our doors to everyone."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6838/production/_132208662_gettyimages-1715808861.jpg|2024-01-04 00:00:00|no writer|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67885910?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Boeing plane: New footage shows inspection after dramatic mid-air blowout|"US investigators have shared footage from inside the cabin of an Alaska Airlines plane which lost a panel mid-flight on Friday. The Boeing 737 Max 9 had just taken off from Portland International Airport when one of its door plugs tore off, leaving a hole “the size of a refrigerator” in its fuselage and causing a rapid decrease in cabin pressure.

US Vulcan rocket launches on Moon mission|The uncrewed Vulcan rocket has launched from Florida to despatch a robotic spacecraft towards the Moon. The Peregrine lander is carrying five scientific instruments for the US space agency, Nasa. If the craft touches down gently on the lunar surface, it will be the first American mission to do so since the famed Apollo missions in the 1960s/70s. The Vulcan left Cape Canaveral at 07:18 GMT (02:18 EST). The Peregrine lander is expected to attempt its landing on 23 February. Just hours after launch, Astrobotic, the company behind the Moon mission, said the spacecraft ran into a technical hitch involving its solar panels. Astrobotic said engineers were working on the issue and would provide updates when it had more information.In the future, the Vulcan rocket will be launching many of America's national security missions.Read more: Vulcan rocket launches private US Moon mission|no image|2024-01-08 15:03:14|no writer|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67910757?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

China and Taiwan: Love and longing across the strait|"Shanshan had never met anyone from Taiwan before January last year.The 24-year-old, from Changsha City in central China, had also not really paid much attention to news about the self-governing island, which her country believes is Chinese territory and has promised to take one day.But then she fell in love - she met her Taiwanese boyfriend playing online video games. They started chatting for hours, long talks during which she discovered he was ""gentle and sensitive"".But even as Shanshan and her partner Guodong share sweet messages across the Taiwan Strait - preparing to meet her parents during the Chinese New Year festival - their governments are trading a ramped-up war of words in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential elections on Saturday. China's President Xi Jinping has cast the decision at Taiwan's ballot box as a choice between war and peace. Under his leadership, Beijing has taken an ever sharper, firmer and often more aggressive tone towards the democratically-governed island, warning the world that it alone will decide how and when unification will happen.However, despite regular military activities in the Taiwan Strait, President Xi has also repeatedly offered ""peaceful reunification"", while Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office maintains that ""both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family"".But those most likely to listen to this message are its own people - not those living across the strait.Shanshan and Guodong have very different views on the future of Taiwan.""My boyfriend just wants to maintain the status quo and doesn't want independence or unification. But I support our country's position and hope for unification one day. We only discuss, we don't argue. The key is that we can't change these things, so we hope for positive developments,"" she says.Their differing views have not affected their relationship. And yet, the issue has created very real barriers for the couple.China banned ""individual tourists"" from visiting Taiwan in 2019. That means Shanshan cannot visit her partner's home or his parents, and she wonders if that will ever change.But things are not much easier for Guodong when he arrives in China.The Taiwan that China wants is vanishingShanshan has discovered that she and her boyfriend may share the same language, and her government says they are the same people, but he faces the same hurdles as many foreigners hoping to settle in mainland China. The administration and paperwork involved for either one of them to stay with the other for any length of time is substantial. Paying for most things involves the need to generate a QR code on pre-registered Chinese phones, with Chinese apps linked to Chinese bank accounts - none of which he has.""For example, when he comes to visit, buying tickets, booking hotels, and making payments are challenging, and even going to tourist sites, taking taxis, or going to the bank, he faces difficulties,"" Shanshan explains.""After being together, I realised that there are many cross-strait couples facing restrictions and difficulties in meeting each other, and the marriage process is complicated and tedious.""China's relationship with Taiwan is therefore critical for this couple. Closer ties could make it easier for them to move between countries. For them, politics across the strait is tangible.For others in China, Taiwan is part of a vision - the government's view of the future. State media highlights the ties between the two as a shining beacon of brotherhood and shared cultural heritage.On a rocky outcrop of Pingtan island in Fujian province, the closest part of the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, tourists pay to stand on a platform and peer through binoculars at an outline of Taiwan 68 nautical miles  (126km) away.Many have travelled thousands of miles to get here. They brave the biting January winds and struggle to brace themselves against the gales as they stare out to sea over the rising white horses. Sea fog and cloud obscure any view of Taiwan, but still, they line up to take photographs at a strategically placed stone arch, using their arms to make love heart signs above their heads.For some, this is a poignant moment.Cui Xiuwen has come from northwest China's Shaanxi province in the hope of just a glimpse of Taiwan.  ""My biggest wish after visiting here is that I hope the island of Taiwan can return to our motherland soon,"" the 61-year-old tells us excitedly.""The urge and feeling became stronger while I've been here. In the past I didn't feel this so keenly. Our compatriots are watching each other across the water and we cannot unite."" She hugs our team warmly as she talks about her fear of conflict. ""We see and hear much talk about Taiwan and the mainland on TV. That's why I want to come here quickly and look at it. I hope Taiwan will be reclaimed in a peaceful way. I don't want war. The casualties will be huge. We want peace."" One young couple - dressed head to toe in Christian Dior - pose for their social media feeds in sunglasses while gazing wistfully out to sea. They stand in stark contrast to some of those who live and work on this island, who admit to rarely thinking about their neighbour, just a few hours away by boat.Dozens of local workers gather in groups on the concrete walls of the small port on the island to sort abalone shells for harvesting. Huddling together out of the wind, wrapped up in fleece headscarves and fishing overalls, they barely look up as they speak to us. They need to keep working to earn money - that is their main concern. ""I don't feel a connection. I have no friends or relatives there,"" says one woman as she uses her knife to scrape through the baskets to release the shellfish. ""I don't care whether it's reunified or not. We ordinary people don't care. This is up to the officials.  We have no wish or hope. We just want enough to eat, we want a better life. We don't care about other things.""Read more about the Taiwan election:The dark rumours trying to destroy Taiwan's trust in USChina is ramping up the pressure for Taiwan's electionThe three men vying to be Taiwan's next presidentThere are around 40 million people living in Fujian province. Many Taiwanese are thought to be descendants of Fujian immigrants, and Beijing often uses these ties as an argument for closer economic and social integration. It wants Fujian province to be the model for ""peaceful unification with the motherland"".It's part of what analysts call a ""carrot and stick"" approach to Taiwan.Or more recently - a display of warships and wooing. China has named its new aircraft carrier after Fujian. It unveiled new images of its first domestically designed warship on state television just last week - part of President Xi's goal of making the People's Liberation Army a ""world class military"".But alongside these flashy displays of military power, there is some evidence that Beijing is attempting to entice more Taiwanese people to the mainland.The Chinese government has unveiled a detailed plan this week to try to bring more Taiwanese investors to Fujian and to encourage Taiwan residents to study, work and live in the south-eastern province. One block of flats in Fuzhou, the BBC found, was even going as far as to offer incredibly cheap rent to Taiwanese people. ""Welcome home"" said the sign on the front door, but when we spoke to a real estate agent they said that any such rental agreement needed permission from various government departments. China also plans to build a high-speed railway across the strait ""at an early date"".The simple fact is the two need each other, economically. China is Taiwan's biggest trading partner, and exports to China have enabled its economy to enjoy strong growth. In an alleyway in Fuzhou, the main city in Fujian province, Li Haoyu from Taiwan tosses noodles into the sizzling wok as customers on mopeds wait for their dinner. He came to China seven years ago for a job at a funeral home. His path from there is a little vague, he's not even sure how old he is. He hasn't been back for five years, but has to return soon as his travel permit to China will soon expire. Taiwanese noodles have a simpler flavour, he says as his swirls the hot pan over the fire.World headlines about war and business worries across the Taiwan Strait do not worry him. He is only concerned with the flow of customers in his street.But he knows the relationship between his past and current homes are not good.""I think the feelings are good between the people. But I don't know how the two governments feel about each other,"" he says as he carefully loads the noodles into a bowl. ""I hope ties can be normalized. I hope the two sides can be like two brothers, like a family,"" he adds.The ties between Taiwan and China after this election could also have an impact on Shanshan's blossoming relationship.Beijing has already warned that any attempt to push for Taiwan's formal independence will mean conflict - although many doubt Beijing will want a war on its doorstep as it battles an economic downturn.All Shanshan can do is ""hope for a better cross-strait relationship"". Luckily, their own relationship is going well, she adds.""Despite the distance, we can be together. Both of us hope for a future together. We can accept these difficulties, and even if it's challenging, we will support and help each other."""|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/464C/production/_132269971_couple-gettyimages-149817112.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Laura Bicker|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-67931901?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Hard choices for the West in Red Sea stand-off|"The mass attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels against vessels in the Red Sea on 9 January was their biggest yet and it signals two things. Firstly, the Iranian-backed Houthis, who control their country's Red Sea coastline, are not backing down in the face of international pressure. Secondly, they clearly have a powerful arsenal of missiles and drones and they are not afraid to launch them at Western warships.In the event, all 21 drones and missiles were shot down by a combination of US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets and missiles launched from US and British warships. But this is expensive, very expensive, and the Houthis know it. A basic Houthi explosive drone costs just under £16,000, while a Sea Viper missile of the sort carried by HMS Diamond costs in excess of £1m. Then there are all the fuel and other costs of maintaining the multinational US-led flotilla of warships under the banner of Operation Prosperity Guardian.""It's clearly not practical in the long term, either logistically or economically,"" says Royal Navy Rear Adm (retd) John Gower, ""to combat a mixture of medium and low-cost missiles and drones with very expensive high-end interceptor missiles.""US and UK hint at action after largest Red Sea attackWhat do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?The risks, too, are mounting.Older US Navy officers will not have forgotten the humiliation of al-Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in Aden harbour in 2000. Using a simple speedboat packed with explosives, al-Qaeda suicide bombers rammed it into the side of that billion-dollar warship, crippling the ship and killing 17 US sailors. Onboard close-range defences have improved since then, but Western warships are not impregnable. Iran, which arms, trains and supports the Houthis, has specialised in the doctrine of ""swarm attacks"", whereby they or their allies will attempt to overwhelm the air defences of their enemy by simultaneously launching a large number of drones or missiles. This is what the Russians have been doing in Ukraine, with partial success, using Iranian-supplied drones coupled with more sophisticated missiles.In the case of Western warships protecting shipping in the Red Sea, Adm Gower warns that ""the supply of [US and British] missiles onboard is probably more limited than those available to the Houthi militia. A lower-scale, longer-term attritional approach by the Houthis would soon cause logistical headaches.""A new report published on Wednesday by the Whitehall think tank Rusi details some of the more sophisticated weaponry available to the Houthis. Its authors say this includes the 400-km range Asef Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM), which carries a 500kg warhead and uses an electro-optical seeker to home in on its target. Then there is the Al-Mandeb 2, an anti-ship cruise missile similar to the one fired by Hezbollah in 2006 against the Israeli ship Hanit.The Rusi report asserts that the Houthis are getting tipped off about shipping movements by an Iranian surveillance ship, the MV Behshad, operating in the lower Red Sea, close to the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait, through which about 15% of global trade normally passes. The recent attacks by the Houthis have forced a growing number of shipping companies to reroute their vessels all the way round the western coast of Africa, adding days, fuel and costs to the journey.Centcom, the division of the US Department of Defense that deals with the Middle East, will have already drawn up detailed strike plans for destroying a range of Houthi military targets along the coast. So given how most of the world deplores the Houthi attacks on shipping, why doesn't the US and its allies take action to stop them?Here's why they are hesitating.The Houthis, formerly known as Ansar Allah, or ""Partisans of God"", have professed themselves to have joined the Gaza war on the side of Hamas. They claim, inaccurately, to be targeting only shipping that is calling at Israeli ports or those vessels with Israeli links to their ownership.This stance, while massively unwelcome to global shipping and trade, is going down very well with their own population and across the wider Middle East, where the popular Arab consensus is that the US is part of the problem because it is feeding Israel's war machine and it has been blocking a ceasefire in Gaza. Arab populations are also dismissive of their own governments' inability to stop the slaughter in Gaza. So much as those governments dislike the Houthis and their Iranian backers, they - with the exception of Bahrain - dare not risk triggering popular unrest by joining any military action against the Houthis.Any US-led attack on Houthi missile launch sites, storage facilities, naval dockyards or command and control centres would undoubtedly be portrayed as ""a US-Israeli attack on the Arab nation"".It would risk inflaming the Israel-Hamas war well beyond its current borders and spark a conflict with Iran which the US is keen to avoid.The Saudis find themselves in an especially delicate position. They have been busy trying to extract themselves from a disastrous civil war in Yemen that they joined in with air strikes against the Houthis in 2015. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed there since then.Not only did the Saudis and their UAE allies fail to reverse the Houthis' illegal takeover of the country, but the Houthis hit back with missile and drone strikes of their own, targeting Saudi airports, cities and petrochemical facilities. According to Rusi, they launched 340 missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia in March 2021 alone. Today, there is a fragile truce in Yemen and the Saudis have no wish to derail that.The Saudi leadership is also acutely aware of how popular the Houthi stand is with some of their own population. As graphic TV reports are beamed in daily of funerals and grieving families in Gaza, the notion of an anti-Western, anti-Israel militia standing up and being part of an ""axis of resistance"" strikes a chord with many Saudis and other Arabs. Should Riyadh side with the US in the Red Sea, it would risk being seen as siding with Israel.Given all the above factors, the US, the West and all the other nations taking part in the multinational operation to protect shipping in the Red Sea would much rather the Houthis simply back down in the face of overwhelming firepower. But that shows no sign of happening, so unless they can be persuaded otherwise, then some sort of limited military action against Houthi facilities may now be imminent."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg|2024-01-10 00:00:00|By Frank Gardner|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67938290?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Mozambique storms: How to cyclone-proof your life|"Mozambican builder José Joaquim is determined to never again put his family through the terror of living through a cyclone in a flimsy house.When Cyclone Idai crashed on to Mozambique's coastline five years ago, he was living with his wife and new-born baby in a shelter with corrugated iron roofing in the city of Beira.""When the winds intensified, we were inside. Because of the noise we couldn't be sure what was happening outside. But then suddenly one of the metal roof sheets blew away,"" Mr Joaquim told the BBC.""And then our door cracked in half because of the wind. We realised that we had to get out of there."" They struggled through winds that kept knocking them down until they reached an evacuation centre at a local school, where for safety everyone packed into the one room that had a concrete roof until the gales subsided.""As a father I felt the responsibility to protect my child and his mother, and thank God! I made a wise decision to leave, to abandon the house so I could save my family,"" the 27-year-old says.Idai caused massive devastation and a heavy loss of life - 1,500 people died and another three million were affected across three countries.Since then other storms have hit the region and with climate change, scientists predict they will only get stronger and more dangerous.This could be catastrophic for a country with the third longest Indian Ocean coastline. Now whenever clouds gather, people here become visibly worried about the possibility of deadly floods brought on by tropical cyclones. This has forced people, like Mr Joaquim, to adapt by building stronger houses and learning safe evacuation methods.He had already been studying civil engineering at the time of Idai, but after surviving the cyclone, Mr Joaquim enrolled on a resilience construction course offered by a college called Young Africa.He has graduated but comes back to teach some of the current crop of students. Tall, friendly and wearing a high-viz waistcoat and yellow hard hat, he is happy to pass on his skills.A group of building apprentices dressed in blue overalls and safety boots have gathered around a small demonstration house. They are learning how to build a roof that has been specifically designed to withstand the extreme winds and torrential rains that come with cyclones.  ""Because of the risk of the roof being blown away, we use metal fixtures to reinforce the roof,"" Mr Joaquim says.""With these resilient construction techniques, we think it can resist at least the force of winds and heavy rains that we saw during Cyclone Idai.""As part of his course, Mr Joaquim helped Young Africa build more than 130 houses across two sites, all designed to provide better protection during a strong cyclone. These ""resilient"" homes were given to people who lost theirs during Cyclone Idai.Mr Joaquim is now putting those skills to use, offering his services to build houses for others in his community and for his own family. He showed me round his half-built house which he is hoping to complete before the next cyclone season. ""Me and my family will be safe. Because of the resilient techniques I used here, we'll be safe,"" he tells me.  A stronger house provides better shelter during a storm, but there are some areas around the coastal city of Beira which are so vulnerable that people need to evacuate when a strong cyclone is predicted. The local council has set up a series of local disaster management committees.These are volunteers who work tirelessly year-round to prepare communities for emergencies, and help them evacuate safely when they arrive. One of these areas is Praia Nova, a fishing neighbourhood of the city set right on the beach.I met up with one of the volunteers that help with evacuations in the event of a storm. ""We work together whenever there's an emergency. Especially when cyclones appear suddenly, we're right there, in the community, working with them,"" says Liria Charomar in a bright orange T-shirt with a colourful wrap around her waist. She knows the importance of a safe evacuation. I noticed a scar on her leg which she says she's had since they were evacuating people through high water during Cyclone Idai.""There were a lot of metal sheets under the water but I couldn't see them, and then when I was lifting my foot, one of them cut my leg,"" she explains. One way of providing protection to vulnerable coastal areas is replanting mangrove forests that have been cut down over the years for building materials and firewood. Between the village and the ocean there is a vast sea of green, with trees ranging from a few centimetres high to a couple of metres in Nhangau, about an hour's drive up the coast from Beira. ""The mangrove serves as a wind barrier,"" says Alberto Santos who has been working with other volunteers who've been replanting trees.""The most intense winds come from the ocean, because the cyclones themselves come from the ocean but then there's a mangrove forest blocking the intensity of the wind. ""This is one of the protection mechanisms.""His tree-planting association has planted 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) of mangrove seedlings over the past 15 years. But for these volunteers trying their best to help their communities, part of the solution lies far away from Mozambican shores. The fact that Mozambique has caused just a tiny amount of the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change is not lost on them.""The residents of Beira are unhappy with this situation caused by other countries,"" says Ms Charoma.""Here in Mozambique, we are already in trouble. We have serious problems like strong cyclones and those countries are still doing these negative things? It's not helping anyone. ""They should let us live like we always did here in Mozambique.""In the meantime, people in Beira will continue to do what they can to adapt to climate change, in the face of an uncertain future.""It's a good feeling knowing that I learned and I'm also passing on what I know to other people,"" says Mr Joaquim.""There's always a desire to look for a solution. So, being part of the solution is important for me, and I think it's important for other people as well.""You can listen to Nomsa Maseko's full documentary Building a future for cyclone-hit Mozambique on the BBC World Service.What you should know about climate change in AfricaCyclone Idai: Maps reveal storm's destructionAfrica storm shows climate crisis reality - UNWhole villages swept away by Madagascar cyclone "|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D29D/production/_132271935_hammer976.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Nomsa Maseko|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67937595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
How Ecuador descended into gang violence|"Terrified journalists being forced to kneel in a TV studio by gunmen pointing high-powered weapons at their heads as the cameras rolled, police officers pleading for their lives after being kidnapped on duty.The scenes which have unfolded in Ecuador show the extent to which this once peaceful haven in Latin America has descended into violence.Here, we take a closer look at how Ecuador became involved in what its president has declared an ""armed internal conflict"".Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, has ordered the armed forces to restore order in the country after days of unrest which saw two gang leaders escape from jail, prison guards held hostage, and explosive devices set off in a number of cities across the country.In the most dramatic attack, a group of armed men forced their way into the studios of TC Television in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, and tried to force one of the presenters to read out a message live on air. The gunmen were eventually overpowered by soldiers and have been arrested but the live footage of the stand-off between the hooded men and the armed forces while TC staff cowered on the floor has terrified Ecuadoreans.The most recent surge in violence kicked off on 7 January when police moved into La Regional, a prison in the port city of Guayaquil, where notorious gang leader Adolfo Macías Villamar, better known as ""Fito"", was being held.The plan had been to transfer Fito to La Roca, a smaller prison within the same compound, which is considered safer as it holds fewer inmates.But when police entered Fito's cell, they found it empty.A government spokesman said that Fito had been tipped off about his impending transfer as early as Christmas, and had escaped before he could be moved.It is not clear when exactly he absconded or how, but two prison guards have been charged with helping him escape. News of his escape triggered riots in at least six jails across the country, with a number of prison guards taken hostage.Many of the prison wings housing Ecuador's most notorious gang members are controlled not by the state, the guards or the security forces, but by the inmates themselves. Individual cells can be rented from the inmates running the wing, and food, drink and drugs which are smuggled into the jail can also be bought from those in charge.A music video recorded by Fito's daughter in September includes footage showing her father in the prison courtyard and gives an idea of why he would not want to leave La Regional.It shows him petting his fighting cockerel and also relaxing with fellow prisoners. His cell is spacious and decorated with garish murals and boasts its own shower cubicle.Fito leads Los Choneros, one of Ecuador's most powerful prison gangs. But there are other prison gangs which control other penitentiaries. In some prisons, individual wings are controlled by rival gangs with the warring sides sometimes only separated by barbed wire. Any shift in the power balance between the gangs - or even a gang-internal power struggle - can turn deadly in this confined and overcrowded space.This became clear when the 2020 assassination of the previous leader of Los Choneros, Jorge Luis Zambrano, led to a split in the gang, with its off-shoots soon turning into mortal enemies of their former comrades.On 21 February 2021, simultaneous fights erupted in four jails between the rival factions - 79 inmates were killed.While the number of dead was shocking at the time, it was surpassed later that year when 123 prisoners were murdered in a gang fight in Litoral prison, which is part of the same compound in Guayaquil from which Fito escaped. In an interview Fito gave to Ecuadorean journalists Andersson Boscán and Mónica Velásquez in 2021 for their series Paz o Plomo (Spanish for Peace or Lead), the gang leader warned that any attempts to move him or other gang leaders to La Roca would trigger a ""sudden death"" scenario in which ""there will be riots at all prisons"".Ecuador is sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, the two largest producers of cocaine in the world.According to the United Nations Global Report on Cocaine 2023, cocaine production recently reached a record high.The security forces in Colombia, in particular, have spent decades trying to stem the flow of cocaine and its police force has received training and support from the United States.But just as police forces have pooled resources in order to disrupt the flow of cocaine, the gangs doing the trafficking have also become more international.Mexican drug cartels and criminal groups from the Balkans gained a foothold in South America after the Farc rebel group, which used to control many of the smuggling routes in Colombia, demobilised as part of a peace deal signed in 2016.These transnational crime groups were keen to explore new ways to transport the cocaine produced in Colombia to buyers in Europe and the United States.And Ecuador with its large ports on the Pacific coast and limited experiences in dealing with crime gangs soon became an attractive transit country for their drug shipments.President Daniel Noboa declared a 60-day state of emergency on Monday and a nationwide curfew from 23:00-05:00 every night. The state of emergency allows the president to send soldiers into prisons to restore order and he can also deploy them across the country to help police with their tasks.Police can stop people in the streets to search them for weapons and also have the power to carry out searches in people's homes if they suspect arms or explosives are hidden inside. The state of emergency prompted an immediate backlash from the gangs. One of the police officers kidnapped while on duty was forced to read out a videotaped statement warning the president that ""you declared war, you will get war"".""You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war,"" the statement continues. On Tuesday as the storming of the TV studio in Guayaquil unfolded, the president went a step further and declared an ""armed internal conflict"".He also ordered the armed forces to ""neutralise"" the gangs behind the violence. He also published a list of 22 gangs which he said would now be considered ""terrorist organisations"".The head of the armed forces also stressed that there would ""no negotiations"" with the gangs who were causing the violence. How he will confront the prison violence which has now spilled over into the streets of Ecuador's main cities is a huge test for Mr Noboa, who has only been in office two months.The 36-year-old was elected in the wake of the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio in August on a promise to combat the gangs which are thought to have been behind Villavicencio's murder.But five months after that shocking event, many Ecuadoreans are again scared to leave their homes as the violence from its prisons has spilled into the streets of major cities.

Animators say ‘AI isn't going to get you an Oscar’|"Comic book writer David Crownson is fearful that artificial intelligence (AI) is ""going to put a lot of people out of work"" in his industry.""With studios and big-name publishers looking for ways to save money and cut corners, they will no doubt use AI technology,"" he says.As the growth of AI surged to prominence last year, writers and illustrators of comic books and animations continue to be particularly concerned about its potential impact on them.After all, AI can produce digital images in seconds, images that wouldn't look out of place in a graphic novel. At least to those of us with untrained eyes. And AI can write stories too.With a small but fast-growing number of AI-made comics and animated TV programmes already released commercially, the technology could transform the industry.There is a lot of money involved - the global comic book market is worth an estimated $15.5bn (£12.2bn) a year, while the animated industry is 25 times bigger, at $411bn.New Jersey-based Mr Crownson is also the boss of publisher Kingwood Comics, which focuses on both promoting black writers, and releasing comic books with black characters.""Now I have to compete with an AI user who can produce faster content,"" he says. ""Also, a white person could tell his AI to create an action adventure comic with black characters.""Mr Crownson points to a similar development that has already happened in the clothing industry, where jeans giant Levi admitted last year to using AI to artificially create photos of black models. He adds that he is fearful that it may lead to a lot of unemployed comic book writers who come from an ethnic minority background. ""AI is dangerous to the employment of black artists,"" he says.AI can never replicate the quality of humans when it comes to storytelling, argues Shawnee Gibbs. Working with her twin Shawnelle, the Los Angeles-based sisters have written graphic novels for Marvel Comics and Harper Collins, and animations for Cartoon Network and Dreamworks Animation.""It is important for us to advocate for human storytellers now, so that there is an industry left for future creators later,"" says Shawnee. ""This is an incredibly unique medium [comics and animation] that gets its DNA from the collaboration of writers and artists. I can't imagine that kind of synergy when you generate stories from AI.""However, her sister Shawnelle says she is ""sure AI will change the industry in ways we can't even fathom at the moment"".She wants to see ""legislation emerge that protects human creators as AI technology evolves"". At present there is little definite in this area, but Californian governor Gavin Newsom is now investigating the issue.Meanwhile, US authorities ruled last year that the images in an AI-created comic book could not be copyrighted. The Gibbs sisters are members of Women In Comics Collective International, an organisation that supports female comic book writers and illustrators. It was established in 2012 by US comic book writer Regine Sawyer.""We discuss the use of AI in our panel discussions, and will continue to do so,"" says Ms Sawyer. ""Our members are very concerned. We want to be very clear about our stance on how AI is used in the comic book industry.""Their stance is that AI is a great tool for research, but not as a creator of material. ""When it's used to replace creators, therein lies the problem,"" she adds.Dave Jesteadt, is president of GKids, a US company that produces and distributes animated films. He agrees that the use of AI should be limited to an assistant role, but that he has yet to see this done successfully. ""To the extent that AI can help individual creators as a tool, I look forward to seeing positive examples in the years to come.""Rob Edwards is a screenwriter of animated movies and writer of graphic novels. His film work includes co-writing the script for the Oscars-nominated 2009 film The Princess And The Frog. He fears that AI will deprive both comic books and animations of their inventiveness.""A world of writers using AI is a world of derivative, recycled, impersonal ideas,"" he says. ""Right now, there's a kid out there drawing the next weird but innovative comic book that could inspire millions. My concern is that AI will talk that kid out of it before anybody sees it.""If you think the animated movies you watch are predictable now, just wait until computers are writing them.""Read additional stories on artificial intelligenceWhile established players in both the comic book and animation sectors are understandably concerned about AI, there has been a big growth in AI-powered comic book and animation creation apps aimed at the home user.For animation these include Animaker AI, Blender, Cascader and Deepmotion. While for comic book creation, apps include Comics Maker, AI Comic Factory and Neural Canvas. They make promises such as allowing users to create ""jaw-dropping comics"", or that ""any person can now create a studio quality animated video in an instant"".One person who has created comic books whose images were all drawn by AI is New York-based artist Steve Coulson, and his five-part The Bestiary Chronicles. He says that using AI to create individual images ""can be a pretty simple exercise"".However, he says that when you want to tell a story over multiple images, it ""is a tougher nut to crack"", as you have to ""coax the system to produce consistent characters, settings, stylings, etc, in order to tell a cohesive story"". Yet he adds that this will ""no doubt"" become easier as AI-powered systems are enhanced.Despite the growing popularity of all these apps, Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix, says that AI is not yet good enough to be a threat to professional comic book creators and animators.""AI cannot create an image the way a human mind can,"" he says. ""It's like having a bad writer help you - sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn't going to get you an Oscar.""AI can never surprise us in the way we want our stories and art to be portrayed. Because of this, AI is simply a tool to be used by humans, not to replace them. Otherwise, we sacrifice the originality and creativity that consumers know and love.""Additional reporting by Will Smale."|https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC04/production/_132261546_man333.jpg|2024-01-11 00:00:00|By Susan Hornik|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67922588?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread|"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones.The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease.And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe.Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why.MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking.They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya.The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic.The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge.At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle.Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role.In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS.The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease.""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains.Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer.The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it.Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections.When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says.""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out.""The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time.Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression.Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans.And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains.It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters.The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.

TB Joshua’s daughter: Tortured after standing up to ‘Daddy’|"The BBC reveals how the late megachurch leader TB Joshua, who is accused of committing sexual crimes on a mass scale, locked up his own daughter and tortured her for years before leaving her homeless on the streets of Lagos, Nigeria.Warning: Contains details some readers may find distressing""My dad had fear, constant fear. He was very afraid that someone would speak up,"" says one of the pastor's daughters, Ajoke - one of the first whistle-blowers to reach out to the BBC about the abuse she witnessed at her father's church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan).TB Joshua, who died in 2021 at the age of 57, is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years.Now aged 27, Ajoke lives in hiding and has dropped her surname ""Joshua"" - the BBC is not publishing her new name.Little is known about Ajoke's birth mother, who was believed to be one of TB Joshua's congregants. Ajoke says she was raised by Evelyn, Joshua's widow, from as early as she can remember.Until the age of seven, Ajoke says she had a very happy childhood, going on holiday with the Joshua family to places like Dubai.But one day everything changed. She was suspended from school for a misdemeanour, and a local journalist wrote an article referring to her as the illegitimate child of TB Joshua. She was pulled out of school and taken to the Scoan compound in Lagos.""I was made to move to the disciples' room. I didn't volunteer to be a disciple. I was made to join,"" she says.The disciples were an elite group of dedicated followers who served TB Joshua and lived with him inside the maze-like structure of the church. They came from all over the world, many staying at the compound for decades.They lived under a strict set of rules: forbidden to sleep for more than a few hours at a time, prohibited from using their own phones or having access to their personal emails, and forced to call TB Joshua ""Daddy"".""The disciples were both brainwashed and enablers. Everybody was just acting based on command - like zombies. Nobody was questioning anything,"" she says.Just a child, Ajoke would not follow the rules like the other disciples: she refused to stand up when the pastor came into the room and rebelled against the severe sleeping orders. The abuse started soon after.Not long after arriving, aged seven, she remembers being beaten for wetting the bed and then being forced to walk around the compound with a sign around her neck saying ""I am a bedwetter."" ""The message about Ajoke was that she had terrible evil spirits that needed to be driven out,"" says one former female disciple.""There was a time in the disciple meetings - he [Joshua] said people could beat her. Anyone in the female dormitory could just hit her and I remember just seeing people slapping her as they walked past,"" she says.From the moment Ajoke moved to the church in the Ikotun neighbourhood of Lagos, she was treated like an outcast.""She was, like, kind of labelled the black sheep of the family,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, she opted to only use her first name.Rae remembers a time when Ajoke slept for too long, and Joshua shouted at her to get up. Another disciple took her to the shower and ""whipped her with an electrical cord and then turned the hot water on"", she says.Recalling the incident, Ajoke says: ""I was screaming at the top of my voice, and they just let the water run on my head for a very long time.""Such abuse was never-ending, she says.""We're talking about years and years of abuse. Consistent abuse. My existence as a child from another mother undermined everything he [TB Joshua] claimed to stand for.""The abuse escalated to a different scale when she was aged 17 and confronted her dad about ""accounts, first hand, of people who had experienced sexual abuse"".""I saw female disciples go up to his room. They were going away for hours. I was hearing things: 'Oh this happened to me. He tried sleeping with me.' Too many people were saying the same thing,"" she says.The BBC spoke to more than 25 former disciples - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - who gave powerful corroborating testimony of experiencing or witnessing sexual abuse.""I couldn't take it any more. I walked directly into his office on that very day. I shouted at the top of my voice: 'Why are you doing this? Why are you hurting all these women?'""I had lost every iota of fear for this man. He tried to stare me down, but I was looking in his eyes,"" she says.Emmanuel, who was part of the church for 21 years and spent more than a decade living in the compound as a disciple, remembers that day clearly.""He [TB Joshua] was the first person that started hitting her… then other people joined,"" he says. ""He was saying: 'Can you imagine what she's saying about me?' Even as much as they were hitting her, beating her, she was still saying the same thing.""Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua: A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century.Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel World of Secrets - The Disciples: A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse.Listen now on BBC Sounds Ajoke says she was dragged out of his office and put in a room away from the rest of the church members, where she lived in social confinement for more than a year.It is a form of punishment within Scoan known as ""adaba"", something Rae also experienced for two years. During this time Ajoke says she was repeatedly hit with belts and chains, often on a daily basis. ""I wonder how I lived through those times. I couldn't even stand up for days after these beatings. I couldn't even take a shower. He was trying so hard to stop people listening to me.""One day when Ajoke was 19, she says she was escorted to the front gates of the church and left there. The church security, who were armed, were told she was never to be allowed back in. This was six years before her father died.""I found myself homeless. I had nobody to reach out to. Nobody would believe me. Nothing prepared me for that life,"" she says.As a young woman with no money, Ajoke did what she could to survive and spent many years on the streets.She first contacted the BBC in 2019 after watching a BBC Africa Eye exposé - but it wasn't until others corroborated her story that a long BBC investigation began into uncovering the abuse at Scoan.The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in this investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua.""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it said.With the help of former disciples and some close friends, Ajoke recently managed to get off the streets. But it has led to episodes where she has struggled with her mental health.Yet after everything she has been through, she has remained determined to tell the truth about her father.""Every time I was beaten up, every time I was humiliated, it just reminded me there was something wrong in the system,"" she says.Former disciples have told the BBC that seeing Ajoke stand up to this man was one of the main reasons they started to doubt their faith in TB Joshua.""He kept all of us in slavery, total absolute slavery,"" says Emmanuel.""Ajoke was bold enough to confront him. I see her as a hero."" Truth, Ajoke says, is the most important thing to her: ""I lost everything, my home, my family, but for me, it comes down to the truth.""And for as long as there's breath in me, I will defend that, until the very end.""Her dreams are to one day go back to school and finish her education that was cut so short.This Africa Eye investigation was conducted by Charlie Northcott, Helen Spooner, Maggie Andresen, Yemisi Adegoke and Ines Ward.Church leader abused and raped disciples, BBC finds‘Terrible things happened’ - inside TB Joshua’s church of horrorsHow Nigerian preacher covered up fatal building collapseNigeria's disgraced televangelist TB JoshuaDisciples: The Cover-up on the BBC Africa YouTube channelAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam|"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant.It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180; £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more.  But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam.Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman.So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others.But finding the victims has proved more tricky.""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained.The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers.""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me.The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate.They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived.""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me.Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"".The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey.Man travels 1,000 miles to claim bogus prizeCyber gangs earning less as victims refuse to payThe scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said.When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax.By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me.""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education.Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine.""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety.However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds.""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people.India arrests dozens in call centre 'drugs' scamCyber-attack on Air India server affects millions""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh.While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily.She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me.I ask him if he still trusts the scammers.""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call.""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong.""BBC News India is now on YouTube.
